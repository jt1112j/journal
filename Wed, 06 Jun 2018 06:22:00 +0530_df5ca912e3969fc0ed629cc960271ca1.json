However, the support for the day is seen at 10530 while resistance is seen at 10,640.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>BUY <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/apollo-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">APOLLO TYRES </a>    </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>CMP: Rs 269.05      </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>TARGET: Rs 292     </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>STOP LOSS: Rs 258  </strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe stock has taken support at the 200 DMA on several occasions and currently also after the correction from the peak of 297 to 262 levels,  it has indicated a revival and bottoming out from the 200 DMA which and we anticipate a rise from here on. The chart looks attractive with the RSI indicator also showing a trend reversal has maintained a positive bias.
