However, the Technical indicators and Oscillators setup on the Index charts indicates the higher probability of bullish move from here in the Nifty.  Any level above 10,865 could extend the upward rally towards next resistances of 10,905 and 11,020. On the downside 10,700 is the key support for the Nifty.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>BUY TATA ELXSI</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>CMP: Rs 1,278</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Stop Loss: Rs 1,225</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Target: Rs 1,370</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tStock has registered new all-time high at 1283 with significant jump in volumes.
