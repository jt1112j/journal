The daily trend has turned up in Nifty after 2 days. The support for the day is seen at 10620 while resistance is seen at 10,740. <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sbi\" target=\"_blank\">SBI </a>and other PSU Banks along with <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/itc\" target=\"_blank\">ITC </a>look promising.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>BUY <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/itc\" target=\"_blank\">ITC </a>  </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>CMP: Rs 270.40     </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>TARGET: Rs 292    </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>STOP LOSS: Rs 260</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe stock has witnessed a decent correction from the peak of 288 to bottom out at around 266 levels which is exactly at the significant 200DMA levels and has formed a higher bottom formation pattern in the daily chart. The chart looks very attractive with the risk- reward ratio very much favourable for a buy and with the RSI indicator also showing a trend reversal, the bias has turned positive with potential to rise further in the coming days. With decent volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/target\" target=\"_blank\">target </a>of 292 keeping a <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=stop+loss\" target=\"_blank\">stop loss </a>of 260.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>BUY <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sbi\" target=\"_blank\">SBI </a>    </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>CMP: Rs 270.15      </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>TARGET: Rs 298      </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>STOP LOSS: Rs 255</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe stock has been in consolidation for quite some time at around the 260-270 range gaining strength and has potential to rise further in the coming days. The daily chart looks attractive for an up move where a strong base at 230 levels is maintained forming a double bottom formation and currently has been maintaining above the significant 34 WMA and 50 DMA moving averages to indicate a positive bias. With good volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/target\" target=\"_blank\">target </a>of 298 keeping a <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=stop+loss\" target=\"_blank\">stop loss </a>of 255.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The analyst may have positions in any or all the stocks mentioned above.</em></p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
