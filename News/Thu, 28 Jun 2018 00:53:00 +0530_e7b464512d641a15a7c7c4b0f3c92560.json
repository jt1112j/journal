During the calendar year 2017, India accounted for 32 per cent (in volume) of the US's shrimp requirements, followed by Indonesia (17.8 per cent), Thailand (11.3 per cent), Ecuador (10.8 per cent) and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vietnam\" target=\"_blank\">Vietnam </a>(8.4 per cent).</p>\n<p>\n\tGiven the introduction of <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=simp\" target=\"_blank\">SIMP </a>in 2019, Vietnam's contribution to the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=us+shrimp+imports\" target=\"_blank\">US shrimp imports </a>is expected to drop, with India as a likely beneficiary, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/icra\" target=\"_blank\">ICRA </a>said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"chart\" class=\"imgCont\" height=\"191\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2018-06/28/full/1530127696-2069.jpg\" title=\"chart\" width=\"528\"></p>\n\tDuring 2017, Vietnam exported 350,000 tonnes of shrimp (as against 540,000 tonnes by India), with 19 per cent exported to the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/eu\" target=\"_blank\">EU </a>followed by 17 per cent to Japan and 16 per cent to the US.<br>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\t \n<p>\n\tOf Vietnam's shrimp exports, 150,000 tonnes of raw material was sourced through imports from India for further re-processing. Further, Vietnam exported 30,150 tonnes of value-added shrimp to the US (as against 16,700 tonnes by India) and contributed to 54 per cent (as against 5 per cent of India) of Vietnam’s shrimp exports to the US during CY2017.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Going forward, as Vietnam’s shrimp exports to the US could be hampered by the SIMP requirements and high anti-dumping duty, this would impact India’s exports to Vietnam. However, this opens up direct export opportunities for Indian exports to the US, particularly of VA shrimp. <br></p>\n<p>\n\tFurther, we have also recently witnessed an inflow of foreign investments into the Indian aquaculture industry with the US's Aquastar Inc. picking up stake in Sagar Grandhi Exports Pvt Ltd during March 2018. Dutch's Nutreco N.V has also entered into a joint venture with West Coast Group to set up an aqua feed plant in India during June 2018. Similar developments augur well for the Indian shrimp sector in the long-term,” Ponniah added.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
