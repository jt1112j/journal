It has been alleged that <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ril\" target=\"_blank\">RIL </a>delayed disclosing this to shareholders.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe tribunal took up the issue two years ago, when it passed an order asking <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi\" target=\"_blank\">Sebi </a>to do a fresh probe.<br></p><p>\n\t\t<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-to-integrate-surveillance-and-investigation-departments-for-efficiency-118062300008_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sebi to integrate surveillance and investigation departments for efficiency</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>\n\t“While considering the approval given by <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi\" target=\"_blank\">Sebi </a>to the open offer price of NW18 (Network18), it was noticed that the open offer price was based on the clauses contained in the ZOCD Agreement dated February 27, 2012. Accordingly, this tribunal perused the clauses contained in the ZOCD agreement and arrived at a prima facie conclusion that on execution of the ZOCD Agreement, control over NW18 indirectly stood divested in favour of IMT,” said Justice J P Devadhar in the order.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccordingly, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sat\" target=\"_blank\">SAT </a>asked Sebi to conduct a fresh probe and pass an order it. However, Sebi had rejected the plea of the petitioners on the grounds that the transaction did not contribute to a violation in the listing norms since the IMT was not a <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=material+subsidiary\" target=\"_blank\">material subsidiary </a>of RIL.
