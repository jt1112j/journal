The central bank has no powers to remove chairman, director or CEO of state-owned banks and also cannot impose restriction on common directors on PSB boards, among others.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn bank frauds, Goyal said those are conducted by private sector and not by public sector.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"They (private sector) have used the public sector banks as a medium to conduct the fraud,\" he said.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
