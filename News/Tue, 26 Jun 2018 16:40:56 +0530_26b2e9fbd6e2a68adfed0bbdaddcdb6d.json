Moreover, by going global, they have an edge over the numerous crypto exchanges currently based in <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=india\" target=\"_blank\">India.</a></p><p>What sets idap.io apart is that for the very first time, IDAP Simulator, a Simulated Trading Environment is being introduced for the benefit of crypto traders. Using real data, the Simulated Trading Environment lets users experience trading without having to actually buy <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=cryptocurrencies\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrencies.</a> The Simulated Trading Environment will be useful for experienced traders too as it will let them develop and test out new trading strategies.</p><p>The ICO is giving the project a chance to not just do fundraising in order to fuel development of the platform but to also let the community of cryptocurrency traders invest first-hand in a project designed specifically for their trading and investment needs. ICO participants will be able to avail many benefits by holding onto their tokens once the exchange goes live, like getting discounts on trading fees as well as waving off of fees.</p><p>Out of a total of 1 billion tokens, 75 percent are being sold to the public in the ICO. Currently, the pre-sale of the ICO is on, offering IDAP tokens at 25 percent bonus.</p><p>Registered in Estonia, IDAP has been founded by <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=awanish+rajan\" target=\"_blank\">Awanish Rajan </a>(CEO), <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=murali+thakur\" target=\"_blank\">Murali Thakur </a>(CTO), <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=atish+katyal\" target=\"_blank\">Atish Katyal </a>(CFO) and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=anupam+agarwal\" target=\"_blank\">Anupam Agarwal </a>(COO), all of whom are alumni from premier technical institutions like IIT, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=nit\" target=\"_blank\">NIT </a>and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=thapar+university\" target=\"_blank\">Thapar University.</a></p><p id=\"auto_disclaimer\">(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
