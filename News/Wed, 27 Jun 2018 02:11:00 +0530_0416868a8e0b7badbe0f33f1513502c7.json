According to the Reserve Bank's Financial Stability Report (FSR), their gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) as a percentage of gross advances declined to 5.8 per cent in FY18, from 6.1 per cent in FY17. Return on assets rose to 1.9 per cent, from 1.6 per cent the previous year. The capital adequacy ratio (tiers I and II) improved to 22.9 per cent, from 22 per cent.</p>\n<p>\n\tNBFCs have to maintain a minimum in tiers-I and II capital of not less than 15 per cent of aggregate risk-weighted assets.<br></p><p>\n\t\t<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/psu-banks-more-prone-to-frauds-says-rbi-s-financial-stability-report-118062700050_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">PSU banks more prone to frauds, says RBI's financial stability report</a></strong>\n\n\n</p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\n<p>\n\tThe report said there was a deceleration in the share capital growth of NBFCs, whereas borrowing grew 19.1 per cent, implying rising leverage.
