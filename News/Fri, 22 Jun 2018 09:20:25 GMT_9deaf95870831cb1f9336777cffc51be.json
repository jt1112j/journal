The prospect of losing so many jobs has sparked widespread alarm.\n</p><p>In Wales, where Airbus supports around 11,700 jobs, the devolved government run by the UK opposition Labour party said its report was \"extremely worrying\".\n</p><p>\"We have repeatedly warned that the UK cannot take the huge economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift from the single market and the customs union,\" a spokesman said.\n</p><p>A string of airlines, banks and other corporate household names have already activated their contingency plans to move jobs or restructure because of Brexit.\n</p><p>The government has agreed a post-Brexit transition period that will last until December 2020, to allow time for a new economic partnership to be struck with the EU.\n</p><p>But Airbus said this was \"too short\" for a new agreement to be made and \"too short for Airbus to implement the required changes with its extensive supply chain\".\n</p><p>\"In this scenario, Airbus would carefully monitor any new investments in the UK and refrain from extending the UK suppliers/partners base,\" it said.\n</p><p>Williams admitted that \"in any scenario, Brexit has severe negative consequences for the UK aerospace industry and Airbus in particular\".\n</p><span>\n</span><br><span>He called for more clarity on the situation, adding: \"We have sought to highlight our concerns over the past 12 months, without success.\"\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>The government spokesman said it was \"working closely with companies to understand their concerns\".\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>\"Alongside industry (it) will invest almost Â£4 billion by 2026 to ensure the UK remains a world leader in civil aerospace,\" he said.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>Parliament finally approved the government's flagship EU (Withdrawal) Bill this week, ensuring that Britain can now legally leave the bloc, deal or no deal.\n</span><br><span>\n</span></div>"
