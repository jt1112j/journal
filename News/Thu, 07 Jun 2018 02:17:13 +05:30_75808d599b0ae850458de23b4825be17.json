(Website)</figure>\n\t\t\t</section></div><span>\n</span><p>Jivi is a smartphone brand of Magicon Impex. The New Delhi-based company has witnessed decent growth over the years. Recently, it launched Jivi Revolution TnT3 smartphone. Priced at Rs 3,950, the device comes with a 2300mAh battery, 8GB of internal storage and runs on Android 7.0 but the feature that makes it apart is integration of touchscreen display and physical keypad.</p><span>\n</span><p>Out of the box, the overall design looks simple and appealing. The front of the device is dominated by a 4-inch touch screen display with a resolution of 480 pixels by 800 pixels. In usage, the display quality is satisfactory with sharp and crisp resolution—icons look sharp and pixels are visible but reading is a bit of a challenge in direct sunlight. It also houses a front camera on the top, while capacitive touch keys and physical keypad are placed in the bottom.</p><span>\n</span><p>Power and volume rocker keys are placed on the right edge while the left is completely free from any distraction. While a 3.5 mm headset jack and Micro-USB port are on the top edge, the bottom is dedicated for speaker grille. The rear panel is home to Jivi branding along with rear camera and LED flash.</p><span>\n</span><p>Jivi Revolution TnT3 runs on Android 7.0 and is powered by 1.3GHz quad-core processor and 1GB RAM. The phone packs 8GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 64GB via a microSD card. During the review period, the smartphone handled browsing and reading smoothly.</p><span>\n</span><p>On the camera front, Jivi Revolution TnT3 has nothing unique to offer. It comes with 5-megapixel rear camera and 2-megapixel front camera. Both the cameras are average and take pictures with decent details in regular light but same could not be repeated in low-light conditions.</p><span>\n</span><p>The Jivi Revolution TnT3 is a dual SIM smartphone that accepts two SIMs. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB OTG, 3G and 4G. Sensors on the phone include proximity sensor and accelerometer. The 2300mAh battery helped the device clock around 6-8 hours of use. Overall, the Jivi Revolution TnT3 is a decent entry-level smartphone with physical keyboard plus touch input and a fingerprint scanner.</p><span>\n</span><p>* Estimated street price: Rs 3,950</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
