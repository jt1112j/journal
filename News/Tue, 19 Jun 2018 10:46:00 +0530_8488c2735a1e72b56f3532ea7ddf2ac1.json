They provide their customers with a full-service platform that enables participants to perform and execute transactions across a multitude of investment possibilities.</p><span>\n</span><p>\n\tTraditional markets and the crypto economy, until now, were mutually incompatible where assets such as stocks and commodities had no tradablity with blockchain enabled exchanges. Ingot aims to synergistically bridge traditional assets, such as fiat, with digital assets including ERC-20 tokens and other forms of cryptocurrencies. The IC Digital Bank offers a cryptographic wallet that provides options of trading between fiat, crypto currencies, even stocks and commodities.</p><span>\n</span><p>\n\tIngot Coin is the first digital wallet integrated with a Digital Bank, Exchange, Certifier, Brokerage and an ICO Accelerator.

The IC system is decentralized and built upon the Ethereum blockchain utilizing smart contracts powering the ecosystem.</p><span>\n</span><p>\n\tIts cryptographic wallet provides entry points with a clear and accessible exit, and if so desired, a safe mechanism for holding assets. This will facilitate both fiat and cryptocurrency transactions, combining a digital exchange along with a brokerage to allow users fiat exchange into digital assets, and vice versa.</p><span>\n</span><p>\n\tIngotâ€™s products offer an IC Accelerator and IC Certifier which gives training, certification, rating, consultation services. The main benefit of the IC solution is that it provides participants to access traditional banking services, liquidity pools, cryptographic wallets and traditional asset markets.</p><span>\n</span><p>\n\tNumerous market investors have recently been uneasy with the volatile fluctuation of values in digital currencies, discouraging them from entering the crypto market. Ingot aims to revive confidence with their multifaceted, all-encompassing business model.</p><span>\n</span><p>\n\tThe IC Crypto Certifier exists for educational-based material regarding cryptocurrency ventures for its customers. They truly have an innovative approach to merging common types of investing with new, blockchain solutions.</p><span>\n</span><p>\n\tThe IC Digital Bank performs all transactions, payments, and settlements, while the IC Brokerage allows investors to view current investment options within the user portal. The IC Exchange is compatible with ALL types of currencies, fiat and crypto, held by the secure IC Wallet.</p><span>\n</span><p>\n\tTheir ecosystem gives customers the option to invest in other ICOs vetted by Ingot themselves as an accelerator for legitimate blockchain projects.
