Last fiscal, the total number of such transactions stood at 2,104.70 crore. So far in FY19 (June 14), 411.18 crore transactions have been achieved.</p><span>\n</span><p>“The notification aims at bridging the shortfalls so that we can achieve 2,500 crore digital transaction in FY19,” another senior official said.</p><span>\n</span><p>To promote digital transactions, the government is providing incentives and cashbacks to merchants and consumers.</p><span>\n</span><p>Last month, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) activated a cashback scheme for consumers and merchants of the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.</p><span>\n</span><p>Under the scheme, customers will get an initial cashback of Rs 51 on the firm successful completion of their transaction, as long as it is more than one rupee. Subsequently, they can get cashbacks of up to Rs 750 per month. Each unique transaction worth Rs 100 and above will yield a cashback of Rs 25, subject to a total monthly cap of Rs 500 in cashbacks.</p><span>\n</span><p>Similarly, merchants will be entitled to a maximum cashback of Rs 1,000 per month. They will receive a cashback worth 10% of the value of each transaction, subject to a cap of Rs 50 per transaction. Also, they must record more than 10 credit transactions per month, each of which should be more than Rs 25, in order to be eligible for the cashback.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
