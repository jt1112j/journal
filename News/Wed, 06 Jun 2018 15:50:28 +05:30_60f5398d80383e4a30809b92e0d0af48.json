This was the first hike by RBI in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a>’s four-year era.</p><span>\n</span><p>Over the last three&nbsp;days, the Monetary Policy Committee carefully reviewed evolving global and domestic macro developments. We noted that global economic activity and trade has continued to expand though there has been some easing of momentum since our April&nbsp;meeting. Inflation pressures have emerged in key advanced and emerging economies driven by the rising commodity prices,&nbsp;especially those of crude oil and petroleum. Financial market activity has been mainly driven by the MPC expectations and geopolitical developments, RBI governor Urijit Patel said in the press conference.</p><span>\n</span><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS from RBI’s 2nd MPC — June 2018 FY19</strong></p><span>\n</span><ol>\n<li>Repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) has been raised by 25 basis points to 6.25% in a first rate hike in four-and-half-years.</li>\n<li>Reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6% and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate has been adjusted to 6.5%.</li>\n<li>The MPC has decided to retain the projection of GDP growth for the financial year 2018-2019 at 7.4% with risk evenly balanced around this number.</li>\n<li>All six members of the MPC including RBI Governor Urjit Patel and Dr Chetan Ghate, Dr Pami Dua, Dr Ravindra H.
