Prices have been Rs 600-650 a kg, stagnant as compared to last year.\n\n\n</p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n<p>\n\t“However, excessive rainfall and lack of sunshine have hampered the production of the second flush of tea. If the weather doesn’t improve, production will be hit,” said Kaushik Basu, secretary, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/darjeeling-tea\" target=\"_blank\">Darjeeling Tea </a>Association, adding that during the first fortnight of June, production had been hit by 40 per cent.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second flush is the most prized of all varieties of tea in <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/india\" target=\"_blank\">India </a>and one of the costliest in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe income from this flush, which begins in late May and lasts till early August, makes up for 40-60 per cent of any estate’s annual income and helps it defray the expenses during the season when there is no production.<br></p><p>\n\t\t<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/frenzy-around-darjeeling-tea-first-flush-starts-dampening-118050100404_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Frenzy around Darjeeling tea first flush starts dampening</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, excessive rainfall, according to Prateek Poddar, director at Darjeeling Impex, which owns the famed Namring tea estate, will affect the quality of the tea in the second flush and its prices in international <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets\" target=\"_blank\">markets.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, company executives suggested that in the face of labour shortages, the gardens were increasingly resorting to mechanised plucking and shear plucking.</p>\n<p>\n\tNearly 50 per cent of the permanent labourers have vacated the gardens after the Gorkhaland agitation took a toll on their livelihood for over 100 days last year. Workers are usually paid every week.</p>\n<p>\n\tUsually 80 per cent of the 8 mkg of tea produced in Darjeeling is exported in a normal year.
