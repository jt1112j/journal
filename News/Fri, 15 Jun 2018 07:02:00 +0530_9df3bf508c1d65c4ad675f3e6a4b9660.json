A source said the number of investment proposals had reduced to 238 as of end-April, from 269 received a year before; in the past year, only a handful of companies have evinced new interest in the scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt appears a cumulative Rs1.68 billion in incentives has been given till April this year under the scheme, to no more than 18 companies. Various applications have been returned by the government due to incomplete documents and not meeting the eligibility criteria, says a source in the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=ministry+of+electronics+and+information+technology\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.</a> <br><a href=\"http://mybs.in/2UTJhQt\"><br><strong>ALSO READ: Jaitley raises allocation towards M-SIPS, EDF to Rs 745 crore</strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\t<a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/m-sips\" target=\"_blank\">M-SIPS </a>promises a subsidy to companies for capital expenditure - 20 per cent for investments in special economic zones and 25 per cent in other places. For some high capital investment projects, it provides for reimbursement of central taxes and duties.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe scheme was originally designed for three years, but was later extended till 2020. Last year, however, the government cut short the time frame to December 2018 and also capped the amount for incentives to Rs100 billion. Also, the time period to get the incentives was reduced to five years, from the earlier 10 years.  <br></p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\t<br><a href=\"http://mybs.in/2USfjZ8\"><strong>ALSO READ: Govt to give Rs 10,000-cr incentive to electronic manufacturers</strong></a>\n<p>\n\tIn a further tightening of the rules, it was made mandatory for companies to give an undertaking that after receiving the incentives, a unit would remain in commercial production for at least three years. <br></p><p>\n\t\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"Investment proposals under M-SIPS drop to Rs 914 bn in April as firms exit\" class=\"imgCont\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2018-06/14/full/1528995370-5652.jpg\" title=\"Investment proposals under M-SIPS drop to Rs 914 bn in April as firms exit\" width=\"620\"></p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
