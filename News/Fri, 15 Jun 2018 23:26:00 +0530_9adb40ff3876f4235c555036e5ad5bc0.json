That is unexceptionable,\" the union wrote.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt added that this should not mean that RBI totally withdraws itself from on-site supervision and relies on reports sent by the banks taking those as \"sacrosanct\".</p>\n<p>\n\t\"If RBI believes that <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/banking\" target=\"_blank\">banking </a>authorities are responsible enough to mind their operations and responsibilities, and RBI can safely rely on them then that will be definitely dereliction of duty,\" the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=rbi+union\" target=\"_blank\">RBI union </a>said while pointing out the PNB fraud case.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the letter, the union thanked the governor for bringing to the fore regulatory impediments that the RBI is suffering from with regard to public sector banks.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also praised him for putting forward that <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/banking\" target=\"_blank\">banking </a>regulation and supervision should be \"ownership neutral\".</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
