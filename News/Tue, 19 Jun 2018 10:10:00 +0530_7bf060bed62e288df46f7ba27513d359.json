This, experts say, is despite the two key events, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/demonetisation\" target=\"_blank\">demonetisation </a>drive in 2016 and the rush to implement the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/goods-and-services-tax\" target=\"_blank\">goods and services tax </a>(GST), which disrupted the economic growth momentum.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe gain under Vajpayee’s tenure, analysts say, came on the back of the government’s increased focus on infrastructure development, especially roads (the golden quadrilateral, or the GQ), and the push for big bang reforms such as the four big-ticket strategic divestments – in Bharat Aluminium and Hindustan Zinc (both to Sterlite Industries), Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (to Reliance Industries) and VSNL (to the Tata group).<br></p><p>\n\t\t<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/vajpayee-s-nda-versus-modi-s-nda-what-it-means-to-stock-markets-118061800165_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vajpayee's NDA versus Modi's NDA: What it means to stock markets?</a></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBesides the reform/policy measures under Modi’s regime, a key factor that drove <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets\" target=\"_blank\">markets </a>higher has been flows – both domestic and foreign – into the equity markets, analysts say. That apart, India was a favourite among the foreign investors in the emerging market pack given the health of other major global economies.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Modi has been good with reforms as well and opened <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/foreign-direct-investment\" target=\"_blank\">foreign direct investment </a>(FDI) avenues, such as in insurance and aviation. Demonetisation, though a drastic step, was seen as a measure to tackle the menace of black money. Investors saw this in a positive light. The reforms undertaken till now got retail investors and mutual funds, too, to invest in equities as an asset class. This crucial aspect of financialisation was missing in the Vajpayee government,” explains G Chokkalingam, founder and managing director at Equinomics Research.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the numbers prove him right.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/foreign-institutional-investors\" target=\"_blank\">foreign institutional investors </a>(FIIs) pumped in around Rs 717 billion in Vajpayee’s tenure, they have invested over Rs 1,410 billion from May 26, 2014 to June 13, official data shows. Mutual funds, on the other hand, which withdrew a net Rs 66.5 billion in Vajpayee’s tenure, have pumped in a huge Rs 3,345 billion under Modi.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoing ahead, Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, expects flows to <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/emerging-markets\" target=\"_blank\">emerging </a><a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets\" target=\"_blank\">markets </a>to pick up pace. India, he says, will get a share of these, but it will be less than what it deserves due to the outdated capital controls still in place in the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough the jury may still be out on how effective the policies and governance has been under both these regimes, stock market investors surely have seen <em>acche</em><em> din</em> under Modi.<br></p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\t<p>\n\t\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"data\" class=\"imgCont\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2018-06/19/full/1529384516-9331.jpg\" title=\"data\" width=\"620\"></p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
