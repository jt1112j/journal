Model onion prices jumped by 55 per cent on Monday to trade at Rs 8.50 a kg on Monday in Asia's largest onion selling market yard in Lasalgaon compared to Rs 5.50 a kg on Friday. Similarly, model onion prices surged, albeit marginally, in Pimpalgaon to close at Rs 9 a kg on Monday versus Rs 8.40 a kg on Friday.\"Onion supply was disrupted on Monday on .",
