The AGR for the period at `35,697 crore is the lowest since the same period in 2013, when it stood at `35,279.50 crore.</p><span>\n</span><p>Telecom operators pay 3-5% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as SUC and 8% of AGR as licence fee to the department of telecommunications (DoT).</p><span>\n</span><p>Declining tariffs have also impacted the industry’s average revenue per user (Arpu). For instance, industry Arpu for January-March fell 11.3% Q-o-Q to `71.62, while on a Y-o-Y basis, the fall was steeper at 20%.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
