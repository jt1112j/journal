According to the </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Bank\">World Bank</a><p> and IMF, our growth rate is going to be high,\" he said.\n\n</p><span>The President's assertion comes a day after Prime Minister </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi\">Narendra Modi</a><p> spoke on similar lines. Speaking at the Niti Aayog's fourth meeting of Governing Council, Modi stressed that the world expects India to become a $5 trillion economy soon, according to a statement by the Prime Minister's Office. \n</p><span>Observing that the </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/indian-economy\">Indian economy</a><p> has grown at a healthy rate of 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017-18, PM Modi said that the \"challenge now is to take this growth rate to double digits, for which many more steps have to be taken\".\n</p><span>\n</span><strong>HOW DO THE NUMBERS ADD UP?</strong><span>\n</span><br><span>President Kovind got his math spot on when he set 2025 as the deadline to reach the $5 trillion milestone. \n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) doubled from $1 trillion to $2 trillion during 2007-14 and is currently estimated at $ 2.7 trillion. The metric of India's growth may be gauged by the fact that the $337 billion the country added to its </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/China-GDP\">GDP</a><span> between 2016 and 2017, is more than the $323-billion added by Germany and France combined and more than that of 158 countries including Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>So, simply put, basic number crunching reveals that if India keeps adding to its GDP at the current pace ($337 billion) every year, it will become a $5 trillion economy by 2025.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span> \n</span><br><span>\n</span></div></div>"
