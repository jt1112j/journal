Private banks and specifically small and mid-cap private banks should be added along with exposure to NBFCs,” Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research told FE Online.&nbsp;Midcap autos and construction as a sector should be amongst the watchlist for next 1-2 years, Mustafa Nadeem added.</p><span>\n</span><p>Further, a balanced mix of large-cap and small-cap stocks will likely to reap benefits. “We need to have a mixture of both. There are blue-chips which are still available at lucrative levels while small cap has the tendency to grow the portfolio returns exponentially.
