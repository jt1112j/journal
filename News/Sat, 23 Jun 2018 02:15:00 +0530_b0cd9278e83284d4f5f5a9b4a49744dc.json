The move may lead to prices dropping to $70 a barrel as a lot will depend on the sanctions on Iran. For India, more steps are required as it had budgeted prices at an average of $65 a barrel for the current financial year,” said Debasish Mishra, partner at <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=deloitte+touche+tohmatsu+india\" target=\"_blank\">Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu </a><a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/india\" target=\"_blank\">India.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tThe current rise in production has come in the backdrop of resistance by producers like Iran, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/venezuela\" target=\"_blank\">Venezuela </a>and Iraq. The rising prices increased India’s import bill by 25 per cent in 2017-18 to $109.11 billion over the previous financial year.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to reports, the input cost of oil refineries has jumped 40 per cent, compared to six months ago. If crude <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil-prices\" target=\"_blank\">oil prices </a>further increase, the government will be forced to go for a cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel too. For a Rs 1 cut in excise duty, the government will lose about Rs 130 billion.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
