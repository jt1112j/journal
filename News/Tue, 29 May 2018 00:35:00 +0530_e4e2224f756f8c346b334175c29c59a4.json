A widening gap means funding needs to be raised from financial institutions or from own sources, to scale up business.</p><p>\nThe gap is widening faster for the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=services+sector\" target=\"_blank\">services sector </a>at 16 per cent annually, compared with 13 per cent for the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=manufacturing+sector\" target=\"_blank\">manufacturing sector.</a> This is largely because of payment delays, especially in the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=services+sector\" target=\"_blank\">services sector.</a></p><p>\nIn manufacturing, the gap is wider in the faster-growing industries such as auto components, electronic/electrical equipment and chemicals, where funding is required to buy raw material to match increasing sales. In services, industries which require high working capital deployment, such as logistics, distribution and construction-related enterprises, are witnessing widening gaps. Given that banks are very cautious about lending, NBFCs may continue to tap this big opportunity and expand credit to MSMEs.</p><div><span>\n\t</span><img align=\"left\" alt=\"graph\" class=\"imgCont\" height=\"481\" src=\"http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2018-05/28/full/1527520677-4245.jpg\" title=\"graph\" width=\"620\"></div>\n<br>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
