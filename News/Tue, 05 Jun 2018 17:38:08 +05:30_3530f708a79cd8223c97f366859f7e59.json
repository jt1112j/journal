(Reuters)</figure>\n\t\t\t</section></div><span>\n</span><p>Brent crude declined after the US government was said to have asked Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to raise oil supply. The request for a 1 million-barrel-a-day increase follows Washington’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iranian crude exports that had previously removed roughly the same amount from global markets. OPEC pumped 31.9 million barrels a day last month, unchanged from April when production was the lowest in a year, according to a Bloomberg survey.</p><span>\n</span><p>Crude has lost its grip after last month rising to the highest level in more than three years. The decline follows a proposal by Saudi Arabia and Russia to ease output cuts to replace potential supply losses in Iran and Venezuela. With the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ next summit a little over two weeks away, the market is looking for any clues on the scale of possible output increases.</p><span>\n</span><p>“OPEC has every potential reason to raise production, they’ve achieved their mission,” said Nitesh Shah, a commodity analyst at Wisdomtree Europe Ltd. “That’s going to be the focus for the next few weeks now.”</p><span>\n</span><p>Brent futures for August settlement fell as much as $1.13 to $74.16 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and were at $74.31 as of 11:09 a.m. local time. The global benchmark crude traded at a $9.86 premium to West Texas Intermediate for the same month.</p><span>\n</span><p>WTI for July delivery erased gains to trade down 16 cents at $64.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 5 percent below the 100-day average.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
