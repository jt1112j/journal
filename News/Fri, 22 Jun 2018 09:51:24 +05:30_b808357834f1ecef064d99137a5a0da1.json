The dollar slipping from an 11-month peak against other currencies overseas as investors took profits also helped the rupee. Further, fresh foreign capital inflows took the local currency higher but a lower opening of the domestic equity markets capped the rise, dealers said.</p><span>\n</span><p>Yesterday, the rupee had appreciated by 10 paise to close at 67.98 against the greenback on sustained selling of the American currency by exporters and local banks.
