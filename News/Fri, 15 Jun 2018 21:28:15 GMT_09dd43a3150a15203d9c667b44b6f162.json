The buyback price is 14 per cent premium to TCS' Friday closing price of Rs 1,841 on the BSE. Aimed at distributing excess cash to shareholders, the company will repurchase 7.6 crore shares, representing about 2 per cent of its equity capital, on a proportionate basis.\n\n</p><span>The biggest beneficiary of this share buyback scheme will be TCS' parent Tata Sons. Based on its 72 per cent stake in the IT services behemoth, the parent will get Rs 11,502 crore from participating in the programme. The money will give Chandrasekaran additional resources to strengthen </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/TATA-Group\">Tata Sons</a><p>' balance sheet, raise holdings in group companies, retire debt of the telecom business and finance buyouts like Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power.\n</p><span> \n</span><div class=\"image\" data-msid=\"64608952\"><img src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/img/64608952/Master.jpg\" alt=\"Investors\"></div><span> \n</span><br><span>TCS had cash and investments of Rs 79,755 crore on its books as on March 31, 2018. If the company spends the entire Rs 16,000 crore on the share repurchase programme, its cash would come down to Rs 63,755 crore.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>Early this month, TCS chief Rajesh Gopinathan had said that the company's plan is to return at least 80% of its free reserves to shareholders every year. Instead of maximising returns on cash and investments, its strategy would be to distribute surplus money to shareholders, Gopinathan had said. Last year too, the company had spent a similar amount of Rs 16,000 crore on share buyback.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>Investors have been turning the heat on large IT companies to return excess cash to shareholders as they shy away from making big-ticket acquisitions and instead sit on huge cash piles.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>In 2017, four IT companies, including Infosys and Wipro, spent Rs 43,500 crore on share buybacks. Buyback is a tax-efficient means of returning cash to shareholders as compared to giving dividends. It also helps in improving earnings per share and boosts the price of the stock during sluggish market conditions.\n</span><br><span>\n</span></div></div>"
