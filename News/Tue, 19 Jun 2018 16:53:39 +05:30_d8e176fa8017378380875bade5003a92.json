With global aspiration, the then small company set benchmark for&nbsp;disclosures and value system and enhanced the profile for the whole corporate world in India, according to him.</p><span>\n</span><p>“If you look at the SEBI’s recommendations on corporate governance, most of them had been followed (earlier) by Infosys, which was later mandated by the regulator to all<br>companies to follow. So, it improved the whole profile of the corporate world in India, and enhanced corporate governance standards”, Balakrishnan said.</p><span>\n</span><p>Infosys put value before profits, and Murthy always demonstrated leadership by example which attracted a good team of people which came and made the dream much bigger, he said.</p><span>\n</span><p>As long as Infosys sticks to its core value system, and governance standards, it would continue to do well, he said.</p><span>\n</span><p>Infosys as a company, Balakrishnan said, has tremendous amount of goodwill of investors and stakeholders, and “everyone wants the company to perform well.”</p><span>\n</span><p>The company has done extraordinarily well in the last many years and created tremendous amount of wealth for investors.</p><span>\n</span><p>“I don’t see why it (the same thing) will not happen for the next 25 years. Key thing is they should not lose their sight on core value system and principles,” he added.
