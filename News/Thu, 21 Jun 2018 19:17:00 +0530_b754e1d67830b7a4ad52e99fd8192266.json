While overall wage increases are just keeping pace with inflation, salaries for in-demand workers will skyrocket if companies choose to compete for the best and brightest on salary alone,\" Korn Ferry Head of rewards and benefits for the APAC region Dhritiman Chakrabarti said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the study found that Japan would be expected to pay the most, an additional $468 billion by 2030. However, smaller markets with limited workforces are likely to feel the most pressure and by 2030, Singapore and Hong Kong could expect salary premiums equivalent to more than 10 per cent of their 2017 GDP, it said.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, by 2030, China could see an additional wage bill of more than $342 billion, it added.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy 2030, the average pay premium across Asia Pacific per worker is $14,710 per year, however, Hong Kong could face a staggering $40,539 per year per highly skilled worker, Singapore could expect to pay an extra $29,065 and Australia $28,625 more.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt a sector level, manufacturing, a critical driver of growth for emerging economies, may be stalled by the huge impact of the salary surge.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn China the highly skilled worker shortage is expected to exceed one million workers by 2030, meaning that the wage premium could reach nearly $51 billion by the same date, higher than any other country analysed.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
