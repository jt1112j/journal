In January, Defence Minister <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nirmala-sitharaman\" target=\"_blank\">Nirmala Sitharaman </a>handed it technology to manufacture solid propellant boosters for the Indo-Russian <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=brahmos+cruise+missile\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brahmos\" target=\"_blank\">BrahMos </a>cruise missile –– a favour normally bestowed only on defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs).</p><p>\nSolar’s ambitious growth plans in the defence sector rest on the military’s increasing requirement of ammunition and propellants. Besides needing to make up a large shortfall in war reserve ammunition stocks, the military requires warhead explosives and propellants for indigenous weaponry like the Pinaka rocket launcher, the Akash, Nag, Astra, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brahmos\" target=\"_blank\">BrahMos </a>and LR-SAM missiles, indigenous <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=artillery\" target=\"_blank\">artillery </a>guns like the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dhanush\" target=\"_blank\">Dhanush </a>and the Advanced Towed <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=artillery\" target=\"_blank\">Artillery </a>Gun System (ATAGS), and a range of new artillery gun systems entering service, such as the M777 ultra-light <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=howitzer\" target=\"_blank\">Howitzer.</a></p><p>\nIndia currently imports 35 solid propellant boosters annually for the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=brahmos+cruise+missile\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brahmos\" target=\"_blank\">BrahMos </a>cruise missile. In addition, the IAF will be inducting large numbers of BrahMos as an air-launched cruise mssile (ALCM), mounted on the Sukhoi-30MKI fighter. Solar would benefit directly from these orders.</p><p>\nIn July 2016, Eurencoand Solar signed a preliminary agreement to “evaluate various cooperation options”. On Tuesday, that was translated into a “strategic partnership” for supplying “propellants, bombs, ammunition filling and modular charges technologies under the ‘Make in India’ policy for the private sector”, according to a Solar press release.</p><p>\n“This partnership agreement is at the heart of our strategy in India which is today one of the key markets that we aim for as part of our global export policy in Asia”, said <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=eurenco\" target=\"_blank\">Eurenco </a>chief <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=dominique+guillet\" target=\"_blank\">Dominique Guillet.</a></p><p>\nSolar said on Tuesday it is “willing to build dedicated infrastructure facilities with the technical assistance of <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=eurenco\" target=\"_blank\">Eurenco </a>on its explosives and propellant facilities in Nagpur, India”.</p><p>\nBesides Nagpur, Solar manufactures at 24 locations in India and six locations abroad – in South Africa, Turkey, Zambia, Nigeria, Australia and Ghana – for a significant portfolio of American and European customers.</p><p>\nSince it was established in 1995, Solar has built facilities to produce sophisticated, military-grade explosives such as HMX, RDX and TNT.Solar also builds composite propellants, rockets, warheads, mines, tank ammunition, bombs and electronic fuses.</p><p>\nBesides serving defence requirements, Solar also manufactures explosives for the mining and infrastructure sectors, serving Coal India Limited,Singareni Collieries, Vedanta, Reliance, Jindal and other <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/companies\" target=\"_blank\">companies.</a></p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
