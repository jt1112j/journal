The main contributing factors being increase in loan loss provisions, mark to market losses on government securities and provisions and payments to employees,\" Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in the report.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe banking environment remained eventful in 2017-18 as asset quality, resolution of stressed assets and muted credit growth in fist half continued as major challenges for most banks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Higher <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=npas\" target=\"_blank\">NPAs </a>impacted interest income adversely and led to elevated provisions, thus putting pressure on the profitability of banks. Further, some PSBs have been put under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework of RBI, which puts restrictions on key areas viz. dividend payment, branch expansion..,\" the report said.<br></p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\t&nbsp;\n\n<p>\n\tThe external environment has also become more uncertain, despite a positive outlook on growth, it said, adding that trade wars have become more acute and the situation will continue in 2018 in the same direction.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, the banks across the world have revisited their foreign business strategy in line with growing risks, it said.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Such cautions prevails among Indian banks as well. The government has advised banks to rationalise their foreign branches. However, this does not constitute a blanket withdrawal but a more realistic strategy in line with changing trade patterns of the country. This rationalisation in foreign business will therefore continue,\" SBI said.</p>\n<p>\n\tTerming the year gone by \"an exceptional year\" in many ways, SBI said the future strategy of the bank has to be clearly articulated and executed.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt said that in the next two years the bank will adopt a strategy that will achieve a healthy credit growth of 10-12 per cent by 2020.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe lender plans to take a two-pronged strategy of portfolio reordering to reduce its Credit Risk Weighted Assets (CRWA) to total advances ratio and internal reorganisation of the corporate banking.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Revamping of corporate credit structure and system within the bank will proceed on such lines that will widen the universe of clients and focus on new segments. The Corporate Accounts Group (CAG) will focus on high priority and quality individual &amp; group relationships and the concept of Group relationship coordinators will be introduced.\"<br>Besides, the credit risk management function will also be strengthened by on-boarding sector specialists and improving due diligence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Drawing lessons from the experiences in the banking industry during the last year, the Bank has further strengthened the overall internal audit and control process. Human Resource (HR) issues need a fresh look as usage of advanced digital technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data increases within the bank,\" SBI said<br>Also, given the pace of retirements in the next five years, it is important to put in place a robust plan of succession.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Potential leaders will be identified and mentored through customised training programmes to create a strong leadership pipeline. Some of these works are already in progress and concrete action plan will be implemented in the next two years,\" said the report.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs per the report, the Chairman and Managing Director Rajnish Kumar, who was elevated to the post from October 7, 2017, drew a gross salary of Rs 14,25,594.10 by March 31, 2018 as the new chairman.</p>\n<p>\n\tEx-chairperson, Arundhati Bhattacharya, took home a gross salary of Rs 14,69,975.81.
