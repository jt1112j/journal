It's like a four tyres of a car. If one or two tyres are punctured, it will slow down but in our case, three tyres are punctured,\" he said at a public event here on Sunday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Only government expenditure is going on, in the form of health care and some amenities. To keep this expenditure going on, government has continued taxing petrol, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=diesel\" target=\"_blank\">diesel </a>and even <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=lpg\" target=\"_blank\">LPG.</a> It is squeezing money from people in such taxes and spending some from it on public amenities,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tDid you see any investment in the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=power+sector\" target=\"_blank\">power sector </a>recently or any investment coming in some thousand crore industry, he asked.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"For example, out of 10 major companies that went into insolvency, five were steel companies. How can you expect any investment in such sectors,\" he wondered.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe former finance minister lambasted the government for introducing a five-slab Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Post <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=demonetisation\" target=\"_blank\">demonetisation </a>this government has introduced <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=gst\" target=\"_blank\">GST </a>with five tax slabs with cess over it. In other countries, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=gst\" target=\"_blank\">GST </a>is just one tax system but we can have two types of taxation in India. Still, having five slabs is not what we have imagined about GST,\" said <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=chidambaram\" target=\"_blank\">Chidambaram.</a></p>\n<p>\n\t<a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=chidambaram\" target=\"_blank\">Chidambaram </a>also said, \"This government is incompetent to address the economic crisis. It has worsened the situation of <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=indian+economy\" target=\"_blank\">Indian economy.</a>\"</p>\n<p>\n\t\"The industrial utilisation is mere 60% in the country. The export of merchandise, during UPA was $315 billion, which $303 billion last year. Before that, it was not even $300 billion. It shows we are not earning from <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=exports\" target=\"_blank\">exports </a>too,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe even mocked the Mudra loan scheme of the government.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said, \"The average amount of disbursed Mudra loan is Rs 43,000 per person. No major investment can be done with such low amount, except one wants to run a Pakoda stall.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tChidambaram also said that compared to social blunders of the NDA government, economic mistakes are curable and correctable.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"BJP led government has suddenly given a message to certain communities that they are second rank citizens of this country. There is lot of unrest over food habits, social behaviour, active anti-Romeo squads in the country,\" he said.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
