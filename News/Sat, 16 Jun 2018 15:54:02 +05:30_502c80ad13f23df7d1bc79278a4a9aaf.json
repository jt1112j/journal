(Reuters)</figure>\n\t\t\t</section></div><span>\n</span><p>In a move to take on telecom giant Reliance Jio, Airtel has improved its Rs 99 recharge pack. Under the updated prepaid plan, Airtel offers 2GB data, upgraded from previous 1GB data limit, in the 28-days validity period. Also, the plan benefits prepaid customers of 100 SMSes per day, that is 2800 SMSes within the validity period. The plan fares better than Jio’s Rs 98 recharge pack as it offers 2GB 4G access for 28 days with unlimited voice call opportunity but offers 300 SMSes during the entire validity period. So that’s 2,500 SMSes more offered by rival company Airtel.</p><span>\n</span><p>According to reports, the recharge pack is available only in select circles. The pack includes unlimited voice calls, roaming voice call benefits, STD and 100 SMS per day alongside 2GB data being offered instead of previous 1GB data. Reliance Jio had recently launched a ‘Double Dhamaka Offer’ which offers 2GB data for 28 days at Rs 98, which pushed Airtel to bring out the latest pack.</p><span>\n</span><p>BSNL has also entered the competitive market with lucrative packs and is posing a stiff competition for both Airtel and Jio. BSNL’s Rs 98 ‘Data Tsunami’ pack benefits prepaid customers with 1.5GB of mobile data per day for 26 days. Airtel also recently refreshed its Rs 149 recharge pack and is offering 2GB high-speed data fothe r validity of 28 days. So, with this offer, Airtel is offering 56GB data of Rs 2.68. Unlimited voice call, 100 SMS per day and STD and roaming calls are also offered in this pack.</p><span>\n</span><p>Whereas, Reliance Jio in its Rs 149 recharge pack currently offers 42GB of 3G/4G data with 1.5GB data per day for 28 days. Local, roaming and STD calls are offered free with this service. Vodafone on the other still has the costliest recharge pack in this category. Rs 199 recharge pack of Vodafone comes with 1.4GB data for 28 days with free STD, roaming and local voice calls.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
