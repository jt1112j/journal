A timeline has also been drawn for the completion of the projects from seven months to 42 months.</p><span>\n</span><p>According to the affidavit submitted with the Supreme Court, the builders will be developing a total of 40,987 units that are to be completed, which requires `5,112 crore to complete. The Galaxy Group will be making an investment of `2,500 crore in the next four years to revive and construct eight pending residential projects, which would bring relief to over 28,000 customers who have invested in these projects, the official said.</p><span>\n</span><p>India Infoline and Kanodia would construct six projects and one project, respectively. The co-developers have also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Amrapali Group that they would charge 10% of the construction cost.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
