Sugar exports was subject to a subsidy of Rs 55 per tonne of sugar cane payable to cane farmers. However, in the earlier notification, the ministry of consumer affairs had linked the compliance of all past conditions by mills to avail subsidy on exports.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn February and March last year, mills violated the sugar stock limit and sold more sugar in the market than they were supposed to. They did this to generate cash before the year end. However, private <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sugar-mills\" target=\"_blank\">sugar mills </a>that violated this have become ineligible for subsidy. <br></p><p>\n\t\t<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/sugar-industry-knocks-on-prime-minister-s-office-door-for-a-sweetener-118062700034_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sugar industry knocks on Prime Minister's Office door for a sweetener</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the government said in a notification that export subdity will be given to mills who have complied with all orders till 17-18 but the stock limit order for February and March 2018 was not included. This exemption makes several mills, mostly in the private sector, eligible for export subsidy.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, so far, after this subsidy was announced, mills have been able to export hardly 244,000 tonnes out of the 2 million tonnes quota for export permitted by the government. The government had allocated mill-wise export quota for availing subsidy. Praful Vithlani, chairman, All India, Sugar Trade Association, said that, “With the relaxation, we estimate that by September (when the season ends) around a million tonnes sugar would have been exported.”<br></p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-hikes-ethanol-price-by-rs-3-per-litre-move-to-boost-sugar-industry-118062701093_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Govt hikes ethanol price by Rs 3 per litre, move to boost sugar industry</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>\n\tCurrently sugar is exported to China, Sri Lanka, Sudan, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/somalia\" target=\"_blank\">Somalia </a>and Dubai, among other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the notification, the quota of sugar for each mill has been allotted and the government had said that those mills which cannot export sugar can sell their quota and avail subsidy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs of now, sugar is exported by mills in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh because of proximity to ports.
