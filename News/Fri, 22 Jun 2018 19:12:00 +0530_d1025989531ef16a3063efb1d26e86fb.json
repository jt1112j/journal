Iran used the funds to import goods from India.\n\n\n</p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n<p>\n\t\"We are looking at reviving rupee mechanism ... we have to prepare ourselves,\" one of the sources told Reuters, adding that the current payment mechanism might not work from November.</p>\n<p>\n\tA commerce ministry official said India's central bank had yet to decide on moving back to the rupee payment mechanism.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn May, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/us-president\" target=\"_blank\">US President </a><a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump </a>withdrew from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and ordered the reimposition of <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/us-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\">US sanctions.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tSome <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/us-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\">US sanctions </a>take effect from Aug. 6 while those, notably affecting the oil sector, will be effective from Nov. 4.<br></p>\n\n<p>\n\tRefiners in India currently use State Bank of India and Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to buy Iranian oil in euros, according to IOC and other companies.</p>\n<p>\n\tSBI, India's top banker, has written to the Indian refiners and the government to say it would not be able to handle oil payments to Iran from Nov 4, an official at SBI said.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndia refiners receive a 60-day credit period for payments to Iran, suggesting <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil-imports\" target=\"_blank\">oil imports </a>from Iran could be hit from August.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Indian government has not asked its refiners to cut Iranian oil imports, but some firms have started reducing purchases from <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tehran\" target=\"_blank\">Tehran.</a></p>\n<p>\n\t\"So far we don't know what we are expected to do.

Since then, it widened to about $8.5 billion in 2017/18, commerce ministry figures show.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
