The night kits would also come with a new look, they added.\n</p><p>2) The makeover will also include variety cuisines and new uniforms for crew.

These planes operate short and long haul international routes. Currently, Air India has 17 per cent market share on international routes. It has over 2,500 international prime-time slots per week spread across 43 overseas destinations.\n</p><span>\n</span><br><span>4) Officials suggest the makeover is aimed at making the airline 'more customer-focussed with enviable service'. The move is also expected to attract more passengers on international routes and in turn generate more revenues.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>5) Civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu and his deputy Jayant Sinha are expected to unveil the new products.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>The move comes amid eventful developments as far as the future of debt-laden airline is concerned. More than a fortnight after the sale of government's stake in Air India failed to attract any bidder, reports emerged that the government has decided not to go ahead with Air India stake sale in an election year and will provide required funds for its operations.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>Aviation minister Suresh Prabhu however, has reiterated that the government is committed to the sale and will soon review a plan.\n</span><br><span>\n</span></div></div>"
