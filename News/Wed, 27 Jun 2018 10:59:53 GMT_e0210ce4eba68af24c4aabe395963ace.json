Turkish </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Airlines\">Airlines</a><p> Wednesday released its “aviation trends India 2017” survey which shows what flyers look forward to the most on medium to long haul flight.\n\n</p><p>The survey, conducted online, saw a “significantly higher percentage of business and first class travellers expressing a need for child care on board and an area for network generation, compared to economy and premium economy travellers.”\n</p><p>Turkish Airlines GM (northern and eastern India) Ozer Guler said: “The Indian civil aviation sector is on a growth trajectory. Favourable government policies, economic growth, an upwardly mobile middle-class and competitive air fares have given a rise to a willingness for people to adopt air travel as a preferred mode of transport in India. As such, their expectations and demands for services and amenities have significantly evolved. The Turkish Airlines Aviation Trends Survey 2017 gives us a glimpse into this changing landscape and allows us to better address our customers demands and needs.”\n</p><p>The key findings of the survey are:\n</p><span>Before Flight: “Good safety record and the good reputation of an airline are given paramount importance while booking a mid or long haul flight. Good services on board in economy class, flexibility on luggage allowance and option of checking in at least one piece of luggage at no extra cost are especially important for passengers who have children,” it says, adding “all inclusive fares are an additional consideration for a majority of the respondents.”\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>The main paint points for flyers are long queues at check-in counters, crowded waiting areas and insufficient information about possible delays.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>During Flight: “Cleanliness of cabin/lavatory, quality of food and beverages and friendly/attentive/accessible staff are passengers’ (main) expectations regarding a mid or long-haul flight. Mobile phone calls and inflight connectivity ranked high on the preference list of respondents, with a majority expressing an interest in using the services only if charges were slightly higher than normal usage tariffs,” the survey says.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>After Flight: “Access to an arrival lounge and a information desk in the baggage reclaim hall in case of lost luggage are the two most important services on the ground for </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indian-travellers\">Indian travellers</a><span>,” it says.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><p>“The online survey, conducted in partnership with Nielsen, reached out to a respondent pool comprised of individuals aged 18 years or older who have used flights as a mode of travel in the last two years and was conducted between 16 to 26 February, 2018,” Turkish Airlines said in a statement.\n</p><span>\n</span></div></div>"
