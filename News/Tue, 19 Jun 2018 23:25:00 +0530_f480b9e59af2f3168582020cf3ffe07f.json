Generally, the service provider has to submit the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gst\" target=\"_blank\">GST </a>to the government, but under the RCM the buyer will have to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tExperts say this amounts to <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/double-taxation\" target=\"_blank\">double taxation </a>since the importer pays the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/igst\" target=\"_blank\">IGST </a>on <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=cif\" target=\"_blank\">CIF </a>value.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile companies importing goods under the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gst\" target=\"_blank\">GST </a>get input tax credit, those importing other goods such as crude oil may not get refunds and hence their <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=cost\" target=\"_blank\">cost </a>will increase, said Abhishek Jain, partner, EY India.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe same issue is pending before various other courts. Even the constitutional validity of these provisions of the GST is being challenged.</p>\n<p>\n\tAbhishek Rastogi, partner with Khaitan &amp; Co, said: “The matters are pending before various courts to determine the constitutional validity of the provision <em>per se</em> because the Indian importer is not the service receiver at all.”</p>\n<p>\n\tStatutory provisions say the service provider is liable to pay without appreciating that the importer in these cases is not the service receiver, he said.<br></p>\n<p>\n\t<a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=cif\" target=\"_blank\">CIF </a>is different from free on board.
