During the same period in 2017, it was 49,400 hectares; in 2016, it stood at 15,200 hectares.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, the state government advised farmers to sow later (after the monsoon starts), in order to minimise the risk of bollworm infestation. In the last four years, bollworm infestation had hit cotton cultivation in both <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gujarat\" target=\"_blank\">Gujarat </a>and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/maharashtra\" target=\"_blank\">Maharashtra.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, Hasmukh Raval, former chairman of the Gujarat State Co-operative Cotton Federation, said, “A majority of the cotton sowing area in Gujarat is facing acute water scarcity. Sowing can begin only after it rains and there is ample water.”</p>\n<p>\n\t\t<img align=\"left\" alt=\"Pink bollworm likely to hit sowing of the cotton crop in Gujarat\" class=\"imgCont\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2018-06/13/full/1528834878-5548.jpg\" title=\"graph\" width=\"620\" data-pagespeed-url-hash=\"3149758693\" onload=\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);\"></p>\n\tHe added, “As a result, overall sowing is expected to go down by at least 20 per cent.” During this kharif season, cotton sowing is likely to fall by 10 per cent.\n<p>\n\tIn the last cotton season, the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=cotton+association+of+india\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton Association of India </a>(CAI) had revised 17-18 crop estimates from 36 million bales to 36.5 million. It also revised upward export estimates from 6.5 million bales (170 kg each) to 7 million bales. Meanwhile, import estimates were pared from 2 million to 1.5 million bales. Of this, 850 000 bales have already arrived till May.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident of <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=cai\" target=\"_blank\">CAI </a>Atul Ganatra has pegged the domestic consumption for the season at 32.4 million bales.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe carry-over stock at the end of the 2017-18 crop year is estimated to be 1.6 million bales.
