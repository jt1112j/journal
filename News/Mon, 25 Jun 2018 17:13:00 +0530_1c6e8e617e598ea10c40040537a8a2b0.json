Oil has delivered a bit of a sting, hurting the trade balance and stoking price pressures. To keep <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/inflation\" target=\"_blank\">inflation </a>expectations in check, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rbi\" target=\"_blank\">RBI </a>may need to push rates higher again,\" Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hsbc\" target=\"_blank\">HSBC </a>said in a note.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to official data, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/retail-inflation\" target=\"_blank\">retail inflation </a>jumped to a four-month high of 4.87 per cent in May on costlier food items such as fruits, vegetables and cereals, coupled with high fuel rates. In May last year, the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/retail-inflation\" target=\"_blank\">retail inflation </a>was at a low of 2.18 per cent.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hsbc\" target=\"_blank\">HSBC </a>report noted that \"it is hard to see India's central bank following the Fed move for move: it, too, will lag the US by a substantial margin\".</p>\n<p>\n\tAs per the report, there is a divergence in monetary policy across the world. While on one hand, the Fed looks determined to hike further, on the other, central banks elsewhere don't seem to be in a hurry to up the rates.</p>\n<p>\n\tExpectations for Fed rate hikes have increased further in recent weeks, with HSBC's US economists adding another 50 bps in hikes to their projections by end 2019.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven as the Philippines nudged rates higher, officials don't expect a prolonged tightening cycle.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Indonesia, India, Singapore, might hike policy rates, Australia's central bank, Thailand, Malaysia and Bank of Japan may give it a miss, the report said.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Even if much of the world economy is still expanding, relative performance is diverging. And that means monetary policy is too, keeping investors on their toes,\" Neumann said adding that \"divergence will stick around for a while\".</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
