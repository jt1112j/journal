Shares of state-owned Mumbai-headquartered HPCL (Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd) emerged as the top gainers among India’s top three oil merchants on Monday. Shares of the New Delhi-based IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Ltd) and Mumbai-based BPCL (Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd) followed the suit with the share price rising 4-5%.</p><span>\n</span><p>Crude oil prices weakened sharply on Monday on expectations of an increase in the supply output from OPEC (The Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries) and the biggest oil producer in the world Russia. Oil prices fell after China threatened duties on American crude imports in a trade dispute with Washington, while supply from OPEC and Russia was also expected to rise, Reuters said in a report.</p><span>\n</span><p>Shares of HPCL rose 6.2% to a day’s high of Rs&nbsp;325.35; stocks of IOC advanced 5.63% to a day’s top of Rs 177.2 while shares of BPCL added 4.1% to a day’s high of Rs 429.15 on NSE today.

On the renewed trade tensions, Reuters report citing Morgan Stanley said that “downside risks have risen.”</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
