There has not been enough focus on deep seated minerals, which has resulted in more imports,” said R K Sharma, secretary general, Fimi.\n<p>\n\tThe few exploration stories in minerals where the country lacks self-sufficiency -- <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/lead\" target=\"_blank\">lead </a>&amp; zinc in Udaipur (Rajasthan), <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/copper\" target=\"_blank\">copper </a>in Malanjkhand (Madhya Pradesh) and the Hutti &amp; Bharat gold mines in Karnataka have been chance discoveries based on old working, Sharma felt.<br></p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn India, exploration is still a state sponsored activity. Both GSI and MECL undertake exploratory work using taxpayers' money. This is opposed to the practice in leading resource rich countries like Australia, Canada, Brazil, Chile and South Africa. In these countries, private entities better known as junior exploration companies take up the risky venture of mineral exploration by raising funds from venture capital. Such companies make profit out of exploration business by selling mineral concessions to the bigger miners.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAlso, exploration being the cornerstone of mining, the tepid spending on the activity in India does not spur unearthing of deep seated deposits. On every square km, the country's exploration spend is a measly $9 as against $5580 in Australia and $5310 in Canada.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
