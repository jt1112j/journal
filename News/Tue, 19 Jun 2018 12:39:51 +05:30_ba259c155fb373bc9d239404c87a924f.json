Of late, while Indian equities have delivered muted returns and mid and small-cap stocks have shown significant underperformance, traders and investors have turned their attention towards stocks with good fundamental earnings, and which are available for cheap.</span></p><span>\n</span><p><span>ICICI Securities, in a research report released this week, has selected stocks that have underperformed significantly — falling over 20% from calendar year 2018 highs — but have shown evidence of producing ‘sustainable earnings’ and ‘stable outlook’.</span></p><span>\n</span><p><span>Cummins India, Bharat Electronics, Mahanagar Gas, Engineers India, TTK Prestige, Cera Sanitaryware, and Indraprastha Gas are among top mid-cap stocks culled out by the research and brokerage house. The selection is based on ‘sustainable earnings’ screen with significant price correction.</span></p><span>\n</span><p><span>ICICI Securities has maintained a ‘buy’ on Cummins India, which has fallen almost 30% from CY18 high.

Also the stocks are filtered for significant downgrade (&gt;6%) to FY19 earnings during Q4FY18 results season it added,” the research note added.</span></p><span>\n</span><p><b><i>Disclaimer: Views and recommendations given in this section are the brokerage firms’ own and do not represent those of&nbsp;</i></b><b><i><a class=\"Xx\" dir=\"ltr\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.financialexpress.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1529478088196000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOSHQ5lNlsUGMA9x-CjLI3kU5z-A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" data-display=\"www.financialexpress.com\" data-sanitized=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.financialexpress.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1529478088196000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOSHQ5lNlsUGMA9x-CjLI3kU5z-A\">www.financialexpress.com</a></i></b><b><i>.
