The idea is to identify a cluster of villages which have a business potential like weaving and eco-tourism. There has to be an entrepreneur model and it will be proposed to various stakeholders to work together”, said Mahadeo Jaiswal, Director of <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=iim+sambalpur\" target=\"_blank\">IIM Sambalpur.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tThe premier <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=management\" target=\"_blank\">management </a>institute is planning to conduct a series of workshops and identify the clusters for development.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We will reach out to large industries in public and private sector, for funding from their <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=csr\" target=\"_blank\">CSR </a>fund to create the basic infrastructure”, he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor making the business model viable, 10 to 20 villages will be taken as a cluster. The chosen villages would not be far from the airports for the convenience of the visitors.
