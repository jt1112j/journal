    "content": "Russian scientists have developed a method that could protect blockchains from being attacked by quantum computers.\nThe researchers from the Russian Quantum Center in Moscow  developed a solution to the quantum-era blockchain challenge, using quantum key distribution (QKD).\nThe blockchain is a distributed ledger platform that allows consensus in a large decentralised network of parties who do not trust each other.\nTransactions are accountable and transparent, making it useful for a variety of applications from smart contracts and finance, to manufacturing and healthcare.\nOne of the most prominent applications of blockchains is cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.\n\"Blockchain is promising for a wide range of applications. But current platforms rely on digital signatures, which are vulnerable to attacks by quantum computers,\"  said Evgeniy Kiktenko from the Russian Quantum Center.\n\"This also applies to the cryptographic hash functions used in preparing new blocks, meaning those with ...",
