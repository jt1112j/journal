The scheme will replace the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=rashtriya+swasthya+bima+yojana\" target=\"_blank\">Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana </a>(RSBY), which provides cover up to Rs 30,000.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile initially Aadhaar will not be compulsory for identification under the scheme, in its later phase it will be necessary. Families availing of the scheme need to make sure they have Aadhaar registration by the time of their second visit to health care facilities, according to Bhushan.</p>\n<p>\n\tStates can use the ration card, apart from the socio-economic caste census, or SECC, data, to identify beneficiaries.</p>\n<p>\n\tBhushan says in rural areas, 85 per cent of the beneficiaries could be identified using the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/secc\" target=\"_blank\">SECC </a>data while in urban areas 50-60 per cent have been identified.</p>\n<p>\n\tBhushan says states, not insurance companies, will enrol beneficiaries, unlike in the case of the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=rsby\" target=\"_blank\">RSBY.</a> He says this is one of the lessons the government has learnt from the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=rsby\" target=\"_blank\">RSBY.</a></p>\n<p>\n\t“Insurance companies were keen to enrol a person under the scheme but were reluctant to process claims. It was advantageous for them to enrol beneficiaries but disadvantageous to pay the claim. So now states will enrol people.”</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
