They had crossed the eight per cent mark in the middle of June and eased later.</p>\n<p>\n\tMarket analyst said <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rbi\" target=\"_blank\">RBI </a>minutes offered a reprieve to the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets\" target=\"_blank\">markets.</a> Concerns of aggressive rate hikes were subsided by emphasis on maintaining a neutral stance. <br></p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\t<a href=\"https://mybs.in/2VngqF4\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ALSO READ: Root cause of India's banking crisis: A non-existent corporate bond market</strong></a><p>\n\tConcerns of aggressive rate hikes were subsided by emphasis on maintaining a neutral stance.
