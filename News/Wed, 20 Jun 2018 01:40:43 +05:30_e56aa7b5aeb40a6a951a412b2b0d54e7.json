Also, the pace of growth in current account savings account (CASA) at private banks has shot up, with nearly 65% of all new CA deposits between FY14 and FY18 being garnered by them.<br>Simultaneously, the share of public-sector banks (PSBs) in such low-cost accounts has fallen.</p><span>\n</span><p>“Excluding SBI (State Bank of India), PSUs’ incremental SA share is down to under 40% from nearly 50% three-four years ago,” Nomura said in the note, adding that SBI has managed to retain its dominance in the SA market.&nbsp; Over the four-year period, SBI held nearly 30% of all new SA deposits and has lost relatively less ground in the current account space, with around 20% of incremental system CAs.</p><span>\n</span><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1212694\" src=\"https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/06/graph.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"956\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/06/graph.jpg 956w, https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/06/graph-300x146.jpg 300w, https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/06/graph-768x373.jpg 768w, https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/06/graph-620x301.jpg 620w, https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/06/graph-480x233.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px\"></p><span>\n</span><p>On a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis, CA growth was 14% and SA growth 20% over FY16-FY18, up from 9% and 14% growth respectively over FY12-FY16. Nomura attributed part of the higher SA growth to demonetisation as some of the deposits that came to banks as part of the exercise has stayed with them banks. The higher CA growth is explained by better capital markets, it observed.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
