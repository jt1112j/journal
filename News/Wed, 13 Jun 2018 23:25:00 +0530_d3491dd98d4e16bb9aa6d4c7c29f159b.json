The statutory body reckons that there are over 11 lakh unlisted companies but only 200 merchant bankers. On the other hand, there are over three lakh CAs.</p>\n<p>\n\t“This will cause undue hardship to the assessees. Moreover, the merchant bankers are employing a good number of <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chartered-accountants\" target=\"_blank\">chartered accountants </a>and for the impugned valuations also, they would ultimately be utilising the services of CAs,” the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/icai\" target=\"_blank\">ICAI </a>said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe manner of valuation provided by Rule 11UA(2)(b) predominantly mentions application of discounted cash flow method, and CAs have the competence to understand business and cash flow projections, the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/icai\" target=\"_blank\">ICAI </a>felt.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe body had taken several initiatives in the recent past to encourage its members to learn and attain expertise in the field of valuation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt its 375th meeting recently, for instance, the council of the ICAI issued valuation standards to ensure uniformity in approach and quality of valuation output by CAs.</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides the ICAI, four other accounting bodies – the Bombay Chartered the Accountants’ Society, the Ahmedabad Chartered Accountants’ Association, the Lucknow Chartered Society and the Karnataka State Chartered Accountants’ Association – have jointly written to the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cbdt\" target=\"_blank\">CBDT.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to them, the Companies Act, 2013, recognises CAs as being eligible for registration as valuers under Section 247 of the said Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, various regulations issued under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, require CAs to issue a certificate on the discounted cash flows.</p>\n<p>\n\tValuation of business and financial instruments along with other assets has been gaining importance, particularly after implementation of the Indian accounting standards.</p>\n<p>\n\tValuation plays a key role in financial reporting as well as areas such as solvency, mergers and acquisitions, among others.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
