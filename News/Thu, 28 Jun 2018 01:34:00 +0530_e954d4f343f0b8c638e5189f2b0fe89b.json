Increasing economic growth and domestic demand is the prime growth driver on the demand side,” according to Yogendra Singh, vice-president of research and consulting, TransUnion CIBIL.</p>\n <br><a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=delinquency+rates\" target=\"_blank\">Delinquency rates </a>and 90 or more days past due for major <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/retail-lending\" target=\"_blank\">retail lending </a>products saw a fall over the last year.<p>\nWhile <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=delinquency+rates\" target=\"_blank\">delinquency rates </a>for <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/credit-cards\" target=\"_blank\">credit cards </a>and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/home-loans\" target=\"_blank\">home loans </a>rose moderately by 9 basis points and 4 basis points, respectively, loans against property saw a steep rise of 33 basis points.</p><p>\nThe number of accounts increased for all major retail products, including auto loans, consumer durable loans, credit cards, home loans, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/personal-loans\" target=\"_blank\">personal loans </a>and loans against property over the past year, with consumer loans showing the strongest growth of 82.8 per cent.</p><p>\nAs the average ticket size of retail loans saw a moderate growth, the rise in <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/retail-lending\" target=\"_blank\">retail lending </a>market was mainly driven by a high volume growth.</p><p>\n“The retail lending industry continued to expand in a robust and sustainable manner.
