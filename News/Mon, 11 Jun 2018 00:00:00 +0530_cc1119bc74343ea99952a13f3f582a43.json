With each bumper harvest, the stock of sugar grows far in excess of domestic consumption. This is what has happened over the last sugar season (2016-17) and the current one (2017-18); the situation is expected to worsen in the next (2018-19).\n\n\n</p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n<p>\n\tWith international prices also plummeting, as shown by Chart 2, thus ruling out exports as a remedy, the sharp fall in domestic market prices, as shown in Chart 3, meant that farmers ended up facing an all-time high of Rs 220 billion in unpaid arrears from the millers. The government has introduced a buffer stock of 3 million tonnes but even then, next season’s opening stock is likely to be almost double of this year’s.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe key problem is that there is no link between the market prices of the final product (sugar and its by-products) and the administered minimum prices for the input (sugarcane). Both, the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=fair+and+remunerative+price\" target=\"_blank\">Fair and Remunerative Price </a>(FRP), announced by the Central government, and the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=state+advised+price\" target=\"_blank\">State Advised Price </a>(SAP), are far in excess of what market would dictate. Chart 4 shows how <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=frp\" target=\"_blank\">FRP </a>and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=sap\" target=\"_blank\">SAP </a>raise the cost of production. Chart 5 shows how rapidly the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=frp\" target=\"_blank\">FRP </a>has grown over the years — the SAPs tend to be higher still. The government has set new minimum procurement price for farmers at Rs 29 a kg. But even this is higher than the market price for sugar. As such, the mismatch continues. Lastly, the government has raised the target for ethanol blending from 5 per cent to 10. But, as Chart 6 shows, the actual blending achieved in 2016-17 was just 4.3 per cent.\n\t\n\t</p><hr>\n\n<p>\n\t<em><a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=statsguru\" target=\"_blank\">StatsGuru </a>is a weekly feature.
