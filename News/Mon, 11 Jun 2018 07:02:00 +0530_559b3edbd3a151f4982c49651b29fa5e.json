There is also lower carry-over stock. These two factors are likely to pull down exports by 10-15 per cent in the current calendar year,” Ramesh Rajah, president of the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=coffee+exporters+rsquo+association\" target=\"_blank\">Coffee Exporters’ Association </a>said.</p>\n<p>\n\tRajah also said exporters are reluctant to take new orders, as they feel it would be difficult to meet supply commitment due to the lower production. “The order book in the first six months was healthy. However, post the production estimates, exporters are not keen to take more commitment,” he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndia exported 379,876 tonnes of coffee worth Rs 61.25 billion in 2017. Average realisation per tonne was Rs 161,257 during last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndia exports around 70 per cent of its production.
