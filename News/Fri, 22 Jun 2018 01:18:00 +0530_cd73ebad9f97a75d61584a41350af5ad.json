It has lost more than 7 per cent since an April high above $1,365 an ounce. US gold futures were down 0.8 per cent at $1,264.50 an ounce.</p>\n<p>\n\tHoldings of the largest gold-backed <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=exchange+traded+fund\" target=\"_blank\">exchange traded fund </a>(ETF), the New York-listed SPDR <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=gold+trust\" target=\"_blank\">Gold Trust </a>have fallen nearly five percent to 26.645 million ounces since late April. That trend is reflected in other US based ETFs.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Uncertainty would normally fuel demand for gold as a safe haven, which we would see in the physically backed products, but instead we are seeing outflows from the US products,” said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. <br><a href=\"https://mybs.in/2VngOSL\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ALSO READ: Safe-haven buying pushes gold up as trade war brews, but dollar puts a cap</strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\t“From the perspective of a US investor, focused on the domestic market and economy, the threat from trade tensions is much lower than in Europe. US domestic consumption is a major driver of growth and there isn’t a problem there.” That Menke said is why the Russell 2000 equity index , which comprises of small US-listed companies, and the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nasdaq\" target=\"_blank\">Nasdaq </a>index of technology firms, are at record highs.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile higher US interest rates and the prospect of further rises later this year have seen the dollar against a basket of other major currencies climb to its highest since last July.</p>\n<p>\n\tHigher interest rates would typically see investors divest gold, which earns nothing and costs money to store and insure. A rising US currency makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially subduing demand for metals. This relationship is used by funds to generate buy and sell signals using numerical models. <br></p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n\t<br><a href=\"https://mybs.in/2Vnf17X\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ALSO READ: Gold discounts widest in 9-month as higher prices tempered retail purchases</strong></a>\n<p>\n\tAnalysts at <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=activtrades\" target=\"_blank\">ActivTrades </a>agree the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gold-price-drop\" target=\"_blank\">gold price drop </a>is partly to do with the stronger dollar and say that $1,260 represents a first support level.<br></p>\n<p>\n\t\"If the decline continues, we would expect to see bullion testing the lows reached last December, near $1,240.\" Traders say the break of support at $1,265, a Fibonacci retracement level could mean further losses, but that momentum indicators suggested gold was oversold and that a correction was more likely.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/category/markets-commodities-precious-metals-1060801.htm\" target=\"_blank\">precious metals </a>too came under selling pressure.</p>\n<p>\n\tSilver fell 0.2 per cent to $16.24 an ounce, palladium lost 0.4 per cent to $962.15 per ounce and platinum slipped 0.4 per cent to $863.9 an ounce.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
