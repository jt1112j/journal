If we combine this figure with the gains that the states have made due to increase in crude prices, the overall figure will be Rs 374.26 billion,\" the report said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe amount will be sufficient to neutralize the Rs 346.27 billion of revenue foregone if the states impose <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vat\" target=\"_blank\">VAT </a>only on base the price of crude.</p>\n<p>\n\tPost-<a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gst-implementation\" target=\"_blank\">GST implementation </a>in July last year, the tax revenue of the states has gone up in FY18 due to increased tax compliance and broader tax base.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Punjab have gained the maximum from GST, Karnataka, Bengal, UP, MP and Assam have reported a decline in tax collection post-GST.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese states were impacted due to the changes in the nature of taxation as GST has subsumed indirect taxes such as service tax, VAT, excise duty, entry tax, entertainment tax into one, including the taxes under the Centre and the states which contribute to an aggregate of over 55 per cent of tax revenue of these states.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"We expect that while there is a need to optimise tax revenue, for funding social security programmes, there is also a need to insulate consumers from adverse price shocks,\" the report said.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom that perspective, states could come forward and rationalise their <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vat\" target=\"_blank\">VAT </a>rates. After all, crude price falling much below $70 a barrel looks uncertain now, the report concluded.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
