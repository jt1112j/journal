Hence, it is in the interest of justice that both the cases should be tried in the same trial by the special CBI judge, the application said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe court is likely to pass an order in the matter on July 10.<br></p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile, another accused, Manish Bosamiya, on Wednesday filed an application before the special CBI court claiming lack of coordination between the two prosecuting agencies - CBI and ED.</p>\n<p>\n\tAggarwal, Bosamiya's lawyer too, said in the application that, \"The CBI has made him (Bosamiya) an accused and the ED has made him a witness, so how can the person be a witness as well as accused on same facts when both the cases are to be tried jointly?\"<br>The court then issued a notice to the CBI and sought its response on the application by July 23.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe issuance of the fraudulent <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=lous\" target=\"_blank\">LoUs </a>is said to be the crux of the mega financial fraud.</p>\n<p>\n\tAn LoU is a guarantee which is given by an issuing bank to Indian <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-banks-1030101.htm\" target=\"_blank\">banks </a>having branches abroad to grant a short-term credit to the applicant.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn case of default, the bank issuing the LoU has to pay the liability to the credit giving bank along with accruing interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tNirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi are among the main accused in the scam pegged at about Rs 134 billion. They have been booked in nearly half-a-dozen cases related to the bank fraud.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey managed to flee the country in the first week of January days before the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pnb\" target=\"_blank\">PNB </a>was able to detect the fraud.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
