That’s my job now,” Sandberg was quoted as saying to the MIT News late on Friday.</p><span>\n</span><p>After facing criticism over the sharing of its users’ personal information, Facebook has suspended British data firm Cambridge Analytica, which had collected the personal data of nearly 87 million Facebook users without permission. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg issued a formal response to misuse of customer data from its platform. He also apologised in the US <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/congress/\">Congress</a> and in front of the European Parliament leaders.</p><span>\n</span><p>Addressing the class of 2018 in MIT’s Commencement, Sandberg said that “at Facebook, we didn’t see all the risks coming, and we didn’t do enough to stop them”. And it’s also the job of “all of us here,” she said. “It’s not enough to be technologists — we have to make sure that technology serves people.”</p><span>\n</span><p>At the ceremony, where 999 undergraduates and 1,821 graduate students received their degrees, Sandberg noted that “today, anyone with an internet connection can inspire millions with a single sentence or a single image”. “That gives extraordinary power to those who use it to do good – to march for equality, reignite the movement against sexual harassment, rally around the things they care about and the people they need to be there for.</p><span>\n</span><p>“(But) it also empowers those who seek to do harm,” she said.&nbsp; “I hope you will use your influence to make sure technology is a force for good in the world. Technology needs a human heartbeat; the things that bring us together and that bring us joy are the things that matter most,” Sandberg added.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
