The loan was taken for operational expenses of Kingfisher Airlines but was used for other purposes, including procurement of charted aircraft for Mallya's personal use.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>It stated that Mallya laundered the loan money with the help of shell companies with dummy directors that were controlled by him. He had also procured properties in name of these companies. Mallya also allegedly took part of the money abroad through over-invoicing of lease rent for aircraft which he procured from a Mauritius-based company for Kingfisher Airlines. The CEO of the Mauritius company, Veling Narian Ltd, Hitesh Patel, is an ex-employee of Kingfisher Airlines. The chargesheet stated that Kingfisher took flights on lease from various companies, and the rent paid to Veling was much higher than what they were paying to other companies for aircraft of similar specification.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><p>Chargesheet also stated that Mallya diverted part of the bank money (Rs 255 crore) to UK and from there it was transferred into account of his Formula 1 team in the guise of advertising and promotional expenditure. The chargesheet further stated that in 2008, Mallya siphoned off Rs 15.9 crore of the loan money from Kingfisher Airline's account with Deutsche Bank and transfered the money into account of his IPL team RCB.\n</p><span>\n</span></div></div>"
