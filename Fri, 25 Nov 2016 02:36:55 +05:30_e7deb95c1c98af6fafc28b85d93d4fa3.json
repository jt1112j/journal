But its downward growth revisions were less severe than some had expected, with the economy still expected to expand by 1.4 percent next year and 1.7 percent in 2018.</p><span>\n</span><p>“The OBR presented a relatively upbeat set of economic forecasts, expecting only a modest slowdown in growth in the coming years, although they could still prove too cautious,” said MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman.</p><span>\n</span><p>“At the margin the developments support our outlook for the pound to continue to defy more pessimistic expectations.”</p><span>\n</span><p>Against the dollar, which was trading near 14-year-highs, sterling edged up 0.1 percent on the day to $1.2461.</p><span>\n</span><p>Down by almost a fifth against the dollar over the past year, sterling has proven more resilient since the start of October, helped by signs the economy is doing better than many economists had feared after June’s vote to leave the EU and by hopes that Brexit could be softer than some had feared.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
