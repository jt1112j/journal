The project should reduce those delays to less than a day, according to Yes Bank’s chief information officer, Anup Purohit. In later phases, the project could be extended to remittance processing, he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, the process of switching India’s internal trade transactions entirely to blockchain is likely to take time. “It’ll take three to four years before we fully exploit blockchain technology,” Purohit said.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
