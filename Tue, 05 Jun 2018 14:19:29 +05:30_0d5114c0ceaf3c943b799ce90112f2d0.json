The metals magnate slipped past rival Alexey Mordashov Monday as shares of Lisin’s Novolipetsk Steel PJSC climbed 3.5 percent, pushing his fortune to $20.19 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world’s 500 richest people.</p><span>\n</span><p>Lisin, 62, also controls Russia’s largest freight rail operator and interests in shipping, shipbuilding and tourist cruise services. He’s the majority shareholder of Novolipetsk Steel, which has returned 18 percent this year, including reinvested dividends, helping him add $2.17 billion to his net worth. Mordashov, the chairman of rival steelmaker Severstal Pjsc, has seen his fortune increase 2.6 percent to $20.18 billion.</p><span>\n</span><p>Lisin graduated from the Siberian Metallurgical Institute in 1979 and worked various jobs in iron and steel plants. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he moved to Moscow in 1992 and started exporting metals. Within about five years, using trading profits, he acquired a controlling stake of NLMK through the secondary market and became its chairman.</p><span>\n</span><p>Mordashov, 52, had been Russia’s wealthiest person for 267 days, after succeeding Vladimir Potanin. Alisher Usmanov, now Russia’s seventh-richest man, led the list for about two years.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
