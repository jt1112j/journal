Under Australia’s cartel laws, executives can face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty. The three <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=banks\" target=\"_blank\">banks </a>themselves are also being charged with criminal cartel offenses.\n\n\n</p>\n<!-- INPAGE_BANNER -->\n<p>\n\tCriminal charges have been laid against Stephen Roberts, the former country head of Citi Australia; Itay Tuchman, who was head of Citi Australia’s global markets division and now runs global foreign exchange trading in the country; John McLean, Citi’s head of capital markets origination for Australia and New Zealand; Michael Ormaechea, Deutsche Bank’s former Australia CEO; Michael Richardson, former head of equity capital markets at Deutsche’s Australia unit; ANZ Bank’s group treasurer Rick Moscati.</p>\n<p>\n\tAustralia’s banking industry, which thrived during the post-financial crisis years even as bankers elsewhere became symbols of destructive greed, has been convulsed in past months by public outrage. Until now, though, the scrutiny of <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=banks\" target=\"_blank\">banks </a>had mostly centred on years of wrongdoing against retail customers and small businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\t“These serious charges are the result of an ACCC investigation that has been running for more than two years,” Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement detailing the charges on Tuesday. ANZ and each of the individuals are alleged to have been knowingly involved in some or all of the alleged conduct, the watchdog said.</p>\n<p>\n\tCitigroup, <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=deutsche+bank\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bank </a>and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=anz+bank\" target=\"_blank\">ANZ Bank </a>have denied any wrongdoing and said they will defend against the allegations.</p>\n<p>\n\t“<a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=deutsche+bank\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bank </a>reiterates that it believes it and its staff, including two former staff members Michael Ormaechea and Michael Richardson, acted responsibly, in the interests of clients and in a manner consistent with the Corporations Act and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=asic\" target=\"_blank\">ASIC </a>market integrity rules in relation to ANZ’s institutional share placement,” the bank said in a statement . “Both Michael Ormaechea and <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=michael+richardson\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Richardson </a>are highly regarded and have our full support.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=citigroup\" target=\"_blank\">Citigroup </a>said on Friday after the ACCC first unveiled the looming charges that a criminal case would mark an unparalleled foray by prosecutors into an area of Australia’s capital markets that has successfully used underwriting syndicates for decades.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
