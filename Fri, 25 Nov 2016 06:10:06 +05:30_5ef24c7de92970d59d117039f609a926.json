The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/indian-rupee/\">Indian rupee</a> on Thursday hit a lifetime low of 68.86 in intra-day trades against the US dollar due to a strengthening of the dollar against virtually all currencies.</p><span>\n</span><p>The BSE IT index ended the session at 9,434.05, up 114.78 points or 1.23%, while the Sensex closed at 25,860.17, down 191.64 points or 0.74%. Shares of Mindtree have gained around 4.5% in the week so far, followed by TCS and Tech Mahindra whose shares have gained 2.65 and 2.4% in this week so far. Analysts at Kotak recently said, “Indian IT is better-prepared to manage potential changes courtesy increase in local hiring, local acquisitions and continued increase in US wages. On a relative basis, HCLT and Wipro have lower risks than Infosys and TCS.”</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
