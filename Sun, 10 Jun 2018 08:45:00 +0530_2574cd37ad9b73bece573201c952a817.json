RERA has clearly stated the circumstances: war, flood, drought, fire, cyclone, earthquake or any other natural calamity. HIRA makes a significant addition to the clause \"...or any other circumstances as may be prescribed\".</p> <p> The second deviation is on garage. While, RERA clearly states that it needs to have a roof and walls on three sides for parking but does not include unenclosed or uncovered parking space. However, HIRA has removed the clause altogether and defined garage as any parking space sanctioned by the government authority, he said.</p> <p> The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India, Bengal chapter, could not be reached for comment in this regard.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
