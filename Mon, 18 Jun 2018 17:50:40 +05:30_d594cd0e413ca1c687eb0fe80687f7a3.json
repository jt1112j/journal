Will cross 2.75% this year if oil is 70/75$. Must get out of this trap. Let’s make domestic India competitive and world facing. 3% deficit should be our red line.Mindset change is key,” Uday Kotak said in a tweet.</p><span>\n</span><p>A rise in trade deficit due to higher crude oil prices widened India’s current account deficit (CAD) for 2017-18, Reserve Bank of India’s (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/rbi/\">RBI</a>) data showed on Wednesday.
