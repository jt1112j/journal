The report that is authored by Ayon Mukhopadhyay, Director of IIFL Institutional Equities for UK and Europe has opted for the traditional strategy of four forwards, three defenders and 3 substitutes each. “”Sadly, India doesn’t have a contingent at Russia, but I present to you squad of 11 stocks that can be world beaters.
