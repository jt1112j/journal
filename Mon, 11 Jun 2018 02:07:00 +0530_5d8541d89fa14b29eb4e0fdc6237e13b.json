This is equivalent to 12.4 per cent of GDP, or USD 1,988 per person.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe global economic impact of violence is defined as the expenditure and economic effect related to containing, preventing and dealing with the consequences of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe estimates include the direct and indirect cost of violence as well as an economic multiplier. \"The multiplier effect calculates the additional economic activity that would have accrued if the direct costs of violence had been avoided,\" the report noted.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs per the report, human beings encounter conflict regularly whether at home, at work, among friends, or on a more systemic level between ethnic, religious or political groups. But the majority of these conflicts do not result in violence.<br>The fall in peacefulness over the decade was caused by a wide range of factors, including increased terrorist activity, the intensification of conflicts in the Middle East, rising regional tensions in Eastern <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=europe\" target=\"_blank\">Europe </a>and northeast Asia, and increasing numbers of refugees and heightened political tensions in <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=europe\" target=\"_blank\">Europe </a>and the US, it added.</p>\n<p>\n\tAbout the <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=asia+pacific\" target=\"_blank\">Asia-Pacific </a>region, it said it remained the third most peaceful region in the world despite a slight fall in its overall peacefulness. There were notable improvements in both internal and external conflicts fought and relations with neighbouring countries, but violent crime, terrorism impact, political instability and political terror all deteriorated across the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor South Asia, the report said strengthening scores on the Political Terror Scale, refugees and internally displaced person (IDPs) and terrorism impact were only partially offset by a deterioration in external conflicts fought after a border dispute with <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=china\" target=\"_blank\">China </a>flared in the Doklam Pass.
