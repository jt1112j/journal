target=\"_blank\">Insolvency and </a><a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=bankruptcy+code\" target=\"_blank\">Bankruptcy Code </a>(IBC) to debar defaulting promoters with bad debts for over a year till the time a case for insolvency was admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), besides their related parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter various stakeholders complained about the wide scope of this clause, it is being diluted for certain sections now on the recommendations of a panel, headed by corporate affairs secretary Injeti Srinivas.  <br></p>\n<p>\n\tWhile pure financial firms will be allowed to take part in the resolution process of the companies going under insolvency process, companies that have acquired defaulting firms would be allowed to do so for three years from the date of approval of resolution plan by <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=nclt\"

that pure play financial entities must be exempt from the disqualification under the clause (c) of section 29A of the Code which debars persons who have an <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=npa+account\" target=\"_blank\">NPA account </a>or are related parties from being resolution applicants.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe panel recommended that the term 'financial entities' may be defined in the Code to clarify the scope of</p>\n<p>\n\tthe exemption.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Committee also agreed that this exemption must not be applicable to financial entities if they are related parties of the promoters of defaulting companies. <br><a href=\"http://mybs.in/2VmxL7g\"><strong>ALSO READ: Homebuyers treatment as </strong></a><a

the committee that given the nature of business undertaken by ARCs, scheduled banks , alternate investment funds, overseas financial institutions, and entities such as investment vehicles, foreign portfolio investors and foreign venture capital investors are likely to be related to companies and hence would be disqualified under section 29A.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe committee also suggested that a proviso must be added to section 29A(c) to state that if an <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=npa+account\" target=\"_blank\">NPA account </a>is held</p>\n<p>\n\tonly because of acquisition of a company going under insolvency, the disqualification under that section will not be applicable.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe section 29 (A) is also being diluted for medium and small scale enterprises where promoters are generally bidders for the insolvent companies. Only wilful defaulters having bad debts for over a year would be disqualified from bidding. </p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
