This, he wrote, would enable the mills to clear the pending cane dues.</p><span>\n</span><p>It may be mentioned that political pressure has been building for the state government to come to the aid of sugar millers for clearing up the huge arrears of the cane growers and help pacify angry farmers, especially in the backdrop of the defeat for the ruling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/bharatiya-janata-party/\">BJP</a> in Kairana by-polls in western UP’s sugar belt.<br>The BJP had promised payment to cane farmers within 14 days of selling sugarcane to the mills in its 2017 manifesto.
