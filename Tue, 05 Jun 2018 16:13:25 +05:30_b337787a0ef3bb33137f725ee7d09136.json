In which case we’re in a lose-lose situation,” Rajan told CNBC.</span></p><span>\n</span><p><span>But is there a silver lining? According to the rockstar banker, the US administration’s unpredictability has led to greater cooperation between countries. “I do think that one of the reasons that countries are trying to form good relations with each other is the unpredictability of the US administration at this point. So, there is catalyst which is pushing these countries to talk more together,” he told the channel. </span></p><span>\n</span><p><span>Notably, amid the ongoing concerns in the emerging markets on account of strengthening dollar, Raghuram Rajan said that there will be stresses. “There will be still stresses for emerging markets, they will have to cope with a rising dollar and rising international interest rates and the flow back of capital flows,” Rajan said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Singapore on Tuesday. However, according to the expert, for Asia, narrow current account deficits, moderate inflation and resilient currencies mean the region is insulated. “Some of them can get stressed. At this point I would say, amongst the big ones, no clear and present danger,” he told the channel.</span></p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
