It has very robust processes and there is no cause for concern for any of the stakeholders of ICICI Bank,” he said.\n</p><p>ICICI, India’s third-biggest lender by assets, is battling allegations that its Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar had broken the bank’s code of conduct.\n</p><span>The bank has set up an inquiry into allegations raised by an anonymous whistleblower that Kochhar favoured </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Videocon\">Videocon</a><p> Group in its lending practices.\n</p><span>\n</span><br><span>Videocon’s founders had an investment in a renewable energy company founded by Kochhar’s husband. The bank rejected the accusations of nepotism in March and said the board had “full confidence and reposes full faith” in Kochhar.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>Goyal said the bank’s internal and external inquiry committees would look into the allegations.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>\n</span></div></div>"
