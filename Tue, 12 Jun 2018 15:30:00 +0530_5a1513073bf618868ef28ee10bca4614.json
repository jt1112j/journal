Amongst the broader market indices, BSE Midcap outperformed, with gains of 0.9%, whereas BSE Smallcap closed in-line with benchmark. Barring Metals and Telecom, all the other sectoral indices ended in green with Banks, Capital Goods, FMCG and IT being the top performers. Amongst the global indices, European markets were trading lower, while Asian markets closed on a mixed note.\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\tGoing forward, market participants would be actively tracking global developments, progress of monsoon, currency movement and crude oil prices. Furthermore, FOMC meet outcome scheduled tomorrow will be crucial and it would dictate further course of market. We expect volatility to remain high in the near term and hence would advise investors to stick to only fundamentally sound companies\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Nifty Pharma index ends 2.58% higher.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Average cash balance ticks down to 4.8% in June, from 4.9% in May, but still above the 10-year average of 4.5%\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Allocation to US equities climbs 16ppt to net 1% overweight, the first time investors surveyed have gone overweight in 15 months\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;64% of respondents think the US has the most favorable outlook for profits, a 17-year high; all other regions have net negative profit outlooks\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A record 42% of investors surveyed say companies are over levered, far exceeding the 32% peak in 2008; overall an all-time high of net 34% think corporate balance sheets are overleveraged&nbsp;\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;June rotation shows investors are selling cyclical plays (banks, emerging markets and Eurozone equities) in favor of defensive sectors and US equities\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When asked what catalyst is most likely to stop Fed tightening, 69% of investors surveyed state domestic reasons (lower inflation, higher unemployment, Fed independence); 23% cited emerging market contagion or a debt crisis in the peripheral EU\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This month, the most commonly cited tail risk to the markets is a trade war (31%), followed by a Fed/ECB hawkish policy mistake (26%) and a Euro/EM debt crisis (23%); trade tensions have been the dominant macro concern for investors in 2018\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t·&nbsp;
