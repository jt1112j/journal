However, the support for the week is seen at 10,580 while the resistance would be at 10,920 levels. Pharma sector as said earlier is anticipated to perform well in the coming days and RIL is expected to do well and would be the market driver to pull the index to new heights.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>BUY  <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ambuja-cements\" target=\"_blank\">AMBUJA CEMENTS </a>   </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>CMP: Rs 206     </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>TARGET: Rs 225    </strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>STOP LOSS: Rs 195</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe stock in the past one month has witnessed much erosion from the peak of 252 to bottom out at around 200 levels and has now indicated a pullback recovery with strength and potential anticipated to give a further rise in the coming days.
