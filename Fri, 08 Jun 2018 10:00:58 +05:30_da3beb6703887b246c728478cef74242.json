Banking, oil and gas, and metals among other sectoral indices of the BSE were trading with losses. Out of 1,740 trading companies, 811 were in advances and 850 were in declining trend indicating a bearish sentiment in the market.</span></p><span>\n</span><p><span>The Sensex fell around 92.86 points to trade at 35,370.22 points. On the National Stock Exchange, the NSE Nifty traded at 10,740.75 points — down 27.60 points on Friday. On the BSE, shares of Power Grid and ICICI Bank fell over 1 per cent each, while IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and HDFC added to the downward trajectory of the Sensex.

On the NSE, all sectoral indices barring Nifty IT, Nifty media and Nifty pharma, traded in the red with the Nifty Bank index down 0.61&nbsp;per cent.</span></p><span>\n</span><p><span>On Friday, uncertainty ahead of a crucial meet of global leaders, coupled with Europe’s huge monetary stimulus coming to an end, hampered Asian markets’ risk-appetite which retreated from two-two and a half month highs, Reuters reported. Earlier on Thursday, the S&amp;P and Nasdaq slipped as the technology sector snapped a rally. Eyes were on global trade tensions as well as the US Federal Reserve and European central bank meetings slated for next week. On the Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index lost 1.98 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 95.02 points, led by big gains in McDonald’s and Chevron shares. The Nasdaq composite slumped 54.17 points.</span></p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
