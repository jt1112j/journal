May’18 saw a strong growth of 21% YoY in UK. While April’18 had also seen a 26% YoY growth in UK, that was largely led by a low base. Growth in North America was also strong at 17% YoY while Europe retails continued to decline at 9% YoY (consecutive decline for last 8 months). </p><span>\n</span><p>JLR retail growth ex-China geography stood at a strong 11% YoY, highest in last 14 months. China retails declined 8% YoY mainly due to customers postponing purchases for an impending price reduction post the import duty cut in China to be implemented from July.</p><span>\n</span><p>LR growth of 6% YoY was led by Discovery at 14% YoY; Velar volumes increased 10% MoM (Velar absent last May’18). RR Sport increased 1% YoY, second consecutive growth post 9 months of decline earlier. Discovery Sport/Evoque declined 10%/ 36% YoY also exacerbated due to weakness in China this month. Jaguar E-Pace increased 18% MoM to 3.7k units, while I-Pace (EV) volumes have increased to 41 units vs 18 units MoM. F-Pace/ XF continue their declines at 23%/ 25% YoY.</p><span>\n</span><p>We believe the stock is currently pricing in extreme pessimism of a flattish volume growth for JLR for FY19E. We have factored in a volume CAGR of 7% over FY19-20E for JLR. YTDFY19 retail volume growth for JLR stands at 9% with China yet to bounce back; while we remain watchful of Europe (-9% in YTDFY19) and UK growth sustainability (+23% YoY). </p><span>\n</span><p>The management in their India business analyst meet too highlighted their path to sustained FCF and achieving EBIT margin guidance of 3-5%.
