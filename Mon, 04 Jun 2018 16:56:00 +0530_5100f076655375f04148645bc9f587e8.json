This could weaken PNB's already low core capitalisation further unless the bank is able to save or generate capital through intrinsic sources like non-core asset sales and cost reductions although there is the prospect of the government injecting further capital into the state <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=banks\" target=\"_blank\">banks.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the agency has affirmed PNB's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-' and its <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=support+rating+floor\" target=\"_blank\">Support Rating Floor </a>and Support Rating at 'BBB-'and '2', respectively. The Outlook on the IDR is Stable. PNB's IDR is at its <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=support+rating+floor\" target=\"_blank\">Support Rating Floor </a>of 'BBB-' and reflects our view of the government’s high propensity to provide extraordinary support to <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=pnb\" target=\"_blank\">PNB.</a></p>\n<p>\n\tAn upgrade to PNB's <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=support+rating+floor\" target=\"_blank\">Support Rating Floor </a>and IDR, in the event of a sovereign upgrade, is not likely.</p>\n<p>\n\tPNB's ability to sustain, if not improve, its buffers through sources such as retained earnings, fresh equity raising and stake sales is important for its <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=vr\" target=\"_blank\">VR.</a> <a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/search?type=news&amp;q=fitch\" target=\"_blank\">Fitch </a>will continue to focus on the bank's ability to raise a significant portion of its capital needs - independent of the government - to counter pressures on its asset quality and earnings performance, failing which further action could be taken on the bank's standalone creditworthiness, it added</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
