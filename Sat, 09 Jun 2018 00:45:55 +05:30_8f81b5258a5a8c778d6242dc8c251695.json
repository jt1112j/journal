While valuations are rich, we believe HUL’s strong and superior quality of earnings deserves a premium multiple. Retain our BUY rating, TP unchanged.</p><span>\n</span><p>For FY18, revenue, EBITDA and recurring PAT grew 8%, 20% and 21% YoY respectively; underlying domestic consumer business growth stood at 12% YoY led by 6% volume growth.
