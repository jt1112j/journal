On May 30, the board of the bank had said it would initiate an independent probe into fresh allegations made by a whistle-blower, according to whom Kochhar may have violated the bank’s code of conduct and provisions relating to conflict of interest while disbursing loans to the Videocon group. </p><span>\n</span><p>The conflict may have arisen because of financial transactions between the Videocon group and Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar. Goyal said he was unaware of the reason behind the absence of the government nominee on ICICI Bank’s board at its meetings. </p><span>\n</span><p>“I would not know about that particular meeting but I’ll find it out,” he said in response to a question on the subject. Government nominee Lok Ranjan has not been attending board meetings ever since the Videocon loan controversy flared up in late March. Last month, FE reported that Ranjan will resume attending board meetings once investigators give a clean chit to the board.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
