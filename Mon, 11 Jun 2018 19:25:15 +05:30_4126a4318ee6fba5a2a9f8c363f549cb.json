PSBs which are on the verge of coming under the PCA will improve their financial health within a quarter or two, the official added.</p><span>\n</span><p>The recent tight prudential norms released by the RBI on February 12 have added to the woes of the lenders, he said.<br>As per the revised PCA guidelines released last year, if a bank enters ‘Risk Threshold 3′, it may be a candidate for amalgamation, reconstruction or even be wound up. Among the many metrics that are used to gauge how weak a lender is are capital, net NPAs, RoA and Tier 1 leverage ratio etc.</p><span>\n</span><p>Under PCA, banks face restrictions on distributing dividends and remitting profits and the owner may be asked to infuse capital into the lender. That apart, lenders would also be stopped from expanding their branch networks. It would need to maintain higher provisions and management compensation and directors’ fees would be capped.<br>To resolve the stressed assets in the power sector, the finance ministry is expected to hold stakeholders’ meeting later this list month.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
