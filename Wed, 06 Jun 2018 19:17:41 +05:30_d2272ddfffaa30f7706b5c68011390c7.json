Fair and remunerative price (FRP) is the minimum price which mills have to pay cane farmers.</p><span>\n</span><p>“The ex-mill sugar price which supports the current FRP works out to around Rs 35 per kilo and therefore Rs 29 is inadequate. It will, therefore, be a challenge to expect the sugar industry to clear the huge cane price arrears on this basis,” Verma said.</p><span>\n</span><p>NFCSF President Dilip Walse Patil said the Rs 8,000-crore bailout package for the sugar industry is meagre as compared to Rs 22,000 crore outstanding cane dues of sugarcane farmers. “The fixing of the rate of sugar sale at Rs 29 per kg is unsatisfactory as it is less than the average production cost of Rs 35 per kg,” he said.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
