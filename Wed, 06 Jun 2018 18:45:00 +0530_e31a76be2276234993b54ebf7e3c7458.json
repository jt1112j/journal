This would give them due representation in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) and make them an integral part of the decision-making process,\" the release said.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurther, home buyers would be able to invoke Section 7 of the IBC against errant developers. Section 7 allows financial creditors to file application seeking insolvency resolution process.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe move also comes at a time when many home buyers are facing hardships on account of delayed and incomplete real estate projects.</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier in the day, the Union Cabinet approved revised guidelines on time bound closure of sick and loss making central public sector enterprises and disposal of their movable and immovable assets.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe guidelines accord first priority for utilisation of available land parcels of CPSEs under closure for affordable housing as per the relevant guidelines of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the RBI has red flagged small ticket housing loans and hinted of policy response to check the rising NPA in the segment.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the statement, the RBI said after a careful analysis of the housing loans data, it has been observed that the level of NPAs for the ticket size of up to Rs 200,000 has been high and is rising briskly.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a class=\"storyTags\" href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-banks-1030101.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Banks </a>need to strengthen their screening and follow up in respect of lending to this segment in particular, it said.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring this sector and will consider appropriate policy response such as a tightening of the LTV ratios and/or an increase in the risk weights, should the need arise,\" said the statement on 'Developmental and Regulatory Policies'.</p>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t            </span>"
