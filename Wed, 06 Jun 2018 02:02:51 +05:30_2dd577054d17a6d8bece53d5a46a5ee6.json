(PTI)</figure>\n\t\t\t</section></div><span>\n</span><p>Power Grid Corporation of India’s (PGCIL) Q4FY18 operating performance came 5% below consensus, primarily due to R250 crore foreign exchange rate variation (FERV), though was P&amp;L neutral. Key highlights: 1) FY18 capitalisation at Rs 27,400 crore dipped 12% y-o-y &amp; marginally missed lower end of management’s Rs 28,000 crore guidance; 2) with Rs 94,000 crore projects in hand, management has pegged next three years’ capitalisation at ~Rs 30,000 crore plus on an average (our estimate: Rs 26,000 crore for FY19/20), which we believe is aggressive considering ~Rs 25,000 crore capex.</p><span>\n</span><p>We believe, regulated equity is still likely to post healthy 13% CAGR over FY18-20. There could be some time correction in the stock due to finalisation of CERC’s 2019-24 norms’ overhang. Maintain ‘BUY’ with revised TP of Rs 240 (Rs 250 earlier) building in higher COE due to high risk-free rate. PGCIL’s FY18 PAT grew 10%, which was impacted by Rs 350 crore higher employee expenses on account of pay revision. While the company has filed a petition with CERC for tariff revision (will be cleared in all likelihood, in our view), it has not booked any provisional tariff in its books (contrary to NTPC’s accounting).</p><span>\n</span><p>On operational parameters, availability of transmission lines was at 99.8%. Capitalisation of Rs 27,400 crore in FY18 included completion of ~10 long overdue projects worth ~Rs 6,500 crore.<br>Management estimates FY19 capitalisation/capex ratio at ~1.2x.</p><span>\n</span><p>While FY19/20E ratio could still be ~1.1x, we believe capex growth beyond FY20 could be challenging as: 1) conventional power generation capacity addition will taper to ~10GW pa over the next few years from 23GW (FY10-16); 2) stability in regional imbalances likely post commissioning of transmission corridors; and 3) renewable capacity addition target (25GW pa) looks aggressive considering past 12 months’ ordering scenario (10- 12GW). However, upside in capex emanates from intra-state &amp; international projects.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
