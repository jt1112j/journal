        "content": "<div class=\"section1\"><div class=\"Normal\"><span>NEW DELHI: </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Apple\">Apple</a><span> expects to ship 80 million new model iPhones this year, down 20% from what it had planned at the same time last year, Japanese financial daily the Nikkei reported on Friday, citing industry sources. The California-based firm has asked suppliers to make about 20% fewer components for the three new iPhones it plans to launch in the second half of 2018, compared to last year’s plans for its </span><a class=\"key_underline\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/iPhone\">iPhone</a><p> X and iPhone 8 models, the paper reported.\n\n</p><p>The report added to concerns that consumer passion for new editions of the iconic smartphones may be cooling after years of scorching growth, sending shares in Apple and many of its major suppliers lower and weighing on global stock markets.\n</p><span>\n</span><br><span>“This news needs to be viewed in the context of Apple probably being overly optimistic last year in relation to the prospects for its new phones, leaving it with excess inventory in the first part of this year,” Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. “At least part of this lower order forecast probably relates to Apple just being a little more realistic.”\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>\n</span><div class=\"image\" data-msid=\"64517352\"><img src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/img/64517352/Master.jpg\" alt=\"Apple graph 2\"></div><span> \n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>\n</span><br><span>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares in the company fell as much as 2% on the report, while those in suppliers AMS and Dialog Semi sank 6% and 4.1% respectively. US-based supplier Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm were all down between 1% and 4%.\n</span><br><span>\n</span><p>Many analysts have said the high price of the iPhone X — which sells for $1,000 and is the first iPhone to sport a new design since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015 — is also muting demand for the flagship. “Apple is quite conservative in terms of placing new orders for upcoming iPhones this year,” said one of four industry sources cited by the Nikkei Asian Review. “For the three new models specifically, the total planned capacity could be up to 20% fewer than last year’s orders.”\n</p><span>\n</span></div></div>"
