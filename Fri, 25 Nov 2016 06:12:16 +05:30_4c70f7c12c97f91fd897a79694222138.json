FY2016 earnings were below estimate led by lower-than-expected margin (disappoints across several segments). Order inflow has been strong through this year and provides good revenue visibility for the next year. The company is well-placed to capture the recovery on alignment of its business interests with the government’s vision (energy management, rail and smart city solutions) and higher localization-led improvement in competitive positioning. All these positives and much more are factored in the CMP. Risks to our estimates are on the downside. Maintain Sell.</p><span>\n</span><p>Siemens’ Q4 FY16 sales at Rs 31 billion (up 11% y-o-y when adjusted for sale of Healthcare and Metals Technologies) were marginally below estimate. Good y-o-y growth in the Building Technologies, Process Industries and Drives and Digital Factory were negated by weakness in other segments. Reported Ebitda margin at 7.8% (versus 8.9% q-o-q and 8.5% y-o-y) was below our estimate by over 200 bps. Segmental analysis reveals sharp volatility in margin across segments qoq and yoy, a hallmark of Siemens, and indicates the likelihood of higher cost provisions. Lower-than-expected Ebitda led to PBT at Rs 2.6 billion, 24% below estimate. Full-year FY2016 numbers paint a restraint picture with segmental margins down y-o-y in several key segments and/or remaining subdued. This provides low confidence in margin recovery trajectory as projected by us/consensus.</p><span>\n\t\t\t\t</span></div><div class=\"common-bottom-text\"><p>Get live <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Gainers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Equity Funds</a>.
